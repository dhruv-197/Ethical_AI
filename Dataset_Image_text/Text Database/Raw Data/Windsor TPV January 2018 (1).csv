2013-November-03_12_4,question  in recent days there has been a lot of slander against those who call people to islam  daa iyahs  and dividing them into groups and categories  what is your opinion on that  answer  praise be to allaah  allaah has enjoined justice and good treatment of others  and he has forbidden wrongdoing  hatred and enmity  allaah sent his prophet muhammad  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him  with the same message as he sent all the messengers  namely the call to tawheed and to worship of allaah alone  he commanded him to establish justice and forbade him to do the opposite  i e   to worship anything other than allaah  to cause division and to transgress against the rights of others  in these days it has become very common that people who claim to have knowledge and to be calling people to good slander many of their brothers among the well known daa iyahs  and they talk about the seekers of knowledge  daa iyahs and lecturers  they do that in secret in their own gatherings  but it may be recorded on tapes that are distributed among the people  and they may do it openly in public lectures in the mosques  this behaviour goes against the commands of allaah and his messenger in several ways     it is a transgression against the rights of the muslims  and against the elite of the people  namely the seekers of knowledge and daa iyahs who are striving to make the people aware and to teach them and correct their beliefs and practices  and to organize lessons and lectures  and to write beneficial books     it splits the muslims and causes division in their ranks  they are the most in need of unity and they need to keep away from division  discord and too much gossip amongst themselves  especially when the daa iyahs who are being slandered are from among the ahl al sunnah wa l jamaa ah who are well known for their opposition to bid ah  innovation  and myth  and for standing up against those who promote such things  and for exposing their plots and tricks  we see no benefit to be gained by such actions  except for the enemies who lie in wait for opportunities to harm the muslims  such as the kaafirs  hypocrites and followers of bid ah and misguidance     this action offers support and help for the self serving among the secularists  westernizers and other heretics who are well known for stirring up trouble among the daa iyahs and telling lies against them  and inciting people against them in their writings and recordings  it is contrary to islamic brotherhood for those who are too hasty to help their enemies against their brothers among the seekers of knowledge  daa iyahs and others     this spreads corrupts ideas in the hearts and minds of the common folk and elite  it spreads and propagates lies and false rumours  and causes a great deal of backbiting and slander  it leaves the door wide open to evil people who persist in spreading doubts and stirring up fitnah  and who are keen to cause harm to the believers by accusing them of things that they did not do     much of what is being said has no basis in reality  rather these are illusions which the shaytaan has made attractive to them  through which he has tempted them  allaah says  interpretation of the meaning    o you who believe  avoid much suspicion  indeed some suspicions are sins  and spy not  neither backbite one another      al hujuraat        the believer should interpret what his muslim brother says in the best possible way  one of the salaf said   never think of something that is said by your brother as being bad when you still find room for a good interpretation      whatever ijtihaad is produced by some scholars or seekers of knowledge  in areas where ijtihaad is permitted  the author of said ijtihaad cannot be blamed or rebuked for it  so long as he is qualified to engage in ijtihaad  if someone else has a different opinion  it is better for him to debate with him in a proper manner  striving to reach the truth via the shortest route and leaving no room for the insinuating whispers of the shaytaan or for him to cause trouble among the believers  if that is not possible  and someone thinks that he has no choice but to explain what is wrong with his ijtihaad  then he should choose the best wording and the most subtle way of explaining  and not resort to attacking  slandering or going to extremes in criticizing him  which may cause others to reject the truth or to turn away from it  he should also avoid criticizing specific people  casting aspersions upon their intentions or saying unnecessary or irrelevant things about them  in such cases the messenger  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him  would say   what is the matter with some people who say such and such      the advice i offer to these brothers who have fallen into the sin of slandering the daa iyahs is to repent to allaah for the things that they have written or said that may have corrupted the hearts of some youth and filled them with hatred and grudges  and kept them from seeking beneficial knowledge or from calling people to allaah by making them preoccupied with gossip and talking about this one and that one  and seeking out faults for which they could criticize people  and going to extremes in doing that  i also advise them to offer expiation for the things that they have done by writing and other means that they think they should not have done  and to remove from people s minds the wrong ideas they may have given them  they should focus on fruitful actions which will bring them closer to allaah and will be beneficial to people  and they should beware of being too hasty to accuse people of kufr  fisq and bid ah without any clear evidence or proof  the prophet  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him  said   whoever says to his brother  o kaafir   one of them will be deserving of that description    saheeh  agreed upon  it is prescribed for those who call others to the truth and for seekers of knowledge  if they are uncertain about something said by a scholar or anyone else  to refer to the prominent scholars and to ask them  so that they can explain the facts of the matter to them and remove the confusion and doubt from their minds  in accordance with the words of allaah in soorat al nisaa   interpretatiuon of the meaning    when there comes to them some matter touching  public  safety or fear  they make it known  among the people   if only they had referred it to the messenger or to those charged with authority among them  the proper investigators would have understood it from them  directly   had it not been for the grace and mercy of allaah upon you  you would have followed shaytaan  satan   save a few of you    al nisaa        and allaah is the one whom we ask to reform all the muslims and to unite their hearts in taqwa and to bring the scholars of the muslims and those who call to the truth together in doing that which pleases him and will benefit his slaves  may he unite them in following guidance and protect them against all the causes of division and dissent  may he support the truth through them and humiliate falsehood through them  for he is the one who is able to do that  may allaah bless our prophet muhammad and his family and companions  and those who follow his guidance until the day of resurrection   majmoo  fataawa wa maqaalaat mutanawwi ah li samaahat al shaykh

2013-November-08_10_5,anonymous asked  are you khawarij  mujibrahman  ansarul tawheed deactivated      well  i don t make takfeer on sins  i believe the one that sins  as we all do  has only decreased in imaan  and he has not left the fold of islam  unless he makes istihlal on that sin  contrary to the khawarij who make takfeer on sins as they believe such an action negates iman in its entirety and the one that sins has ruled by by other than what allah has revealed  which according to the khawarij is kufr akbar on all accounts i don t believe in rebelling against the muslim ruler  i believe it is obligatory to obey him and to be patient under him if he is oppressive  as narrated an ijma by ibn taymiyyah and imam al barbahaaree  the muslim ruler must rule according to the revelation of allah  he must fulfil his duty in waging jihad against the disbelievers  and holding the sanctity of the shari ah  i do not believe the blood of the muslims are halal  i believe whoever becomes muslim  and testifies la illaha illalaha  then his blood  wealth  and property are protected  except in the   cases the prophet  sal allahu alayhi wasallam  said it is permissible to spill   in qisas  if he commits apostasy  and in the case of the fornicator   when the commit kufr or shirk akbar  and all the impediments to takfeer are removed  then they are not from the deen of islam and their blood has no sanctity  i do not believe any muslim should be killed unjustly  and to apply the hadd  punishment  on him if he has committed a crime within the shari ah  that is the role of the caliph and the judges to judge upon by the book of allah and the sunnah of his messenger  contrary to the khawarij  who would kill the muslims who would disagree with them and they would leave the mushrikeen  and i believe the mushrikeen and kuffar  their blood has no sanctity  unless it is protected by a treaty or a covenant  as the prophet  sal allahu alayhi wasallam  said  i have been sent to fight the people until they testify la illaha ilallah  and muhammad is his messenger  and they establish their salah  pay their zakah  then their blood and property will be free from me  except through islamic law  so the blood of the kaffir is only protected when he becomes a muslim  and while he is protected by a covenant treaty  i believe the muslims must have baraa   dissociation  from shirk and its people  but they should be made to live under the rule of islam and if they refuse they are to be fought  and the muslims must fight the mushrikeen until this deen belongs solely to allah  as commanded in his noble qur an  i am not harsh with the muslims and soft with the kuffar  rather i strive to be soft and understanding to my brothers of tawheed and the sunnah  and stern against the disbelievers  yet i am still nice to them when it comes to da wah  as that is how i am naturally  and how the muslim should be  he should not be harsh to the extent where there exists no justice  but neither should he be soft and allow himself to be humiliated in the face of the kuffar  so    am i a kharaji  you tell me   lol  if you believe i am  then by allah you either do not know the usool of the madhab of the khawarij  of you have been misinformed by the  ulama you take your deen from  in that case  anyone who thinks i m a kharaji should feel free to kill me if they see me around  as the hukm on the khawarij is that they should be killed  maybe it will be an early kind of martyrdom for me who knows  d ya  ni khawarij lool ansarul tawheed deactivated      well  i don t make takfeer on sins  i believe the one that sins  as we all do  has only decreased in imaan  and he has not left the fold of islam  unless he makes istihlal on that sin  contrary to the khawarij who make takfeer on sins as they believe such an action negates iman in its entirety and the one that sins has ruled by by other than what allah has revealed  which according to the khawarij is kufr akbar on all accounts i don t believe in rebelling against the muslim ruler  i believe it is obligatory to obey him and to be patient under him if he is oppressive  as narrated an ijma by ibn taymiyyah and imam al barbahaaree  the muslim ruler must rule according to the revelation of allah  he must fulfil his duty in waging jihad against the disbelievers  and holding the sanctity of the shari ah  i do not believe the blood of the muslims are halal  i believe whoever becomes muslim  and testifies la illaha illalaha  then his blood  wealth  and property are protected  except in the   cases the prophet  sal allahu alayhi wasallam  said it is permissible to spill   in qisas  if he commits apostasy  and in the case of the fornicator   when the commit kufr or shirk akbar  and all the impediments to takfeer are removed  then they are not from the deen of islam and their blood has no sanctity  i do not believe any muslim should be killed unjustly  and to apply the hadd  punishment  on him if he has committed a crime within the shari ah  that is the role of the caliph and the judges to judge upon by the book of allah and the sunnah of his messenger  contrary to the khawarij  who would kill the muslims who would disagree with them and they would leave the mushrikeen  and i believe the mushrikeen and kuffar  their blood has no sanctity  unless it is protected by a treaty or a covenant  as the prophet  sal allahu alayhi wasallam  said  i have been sent to fight the people until they testify la illaha ilallah  and muhammad is his messenger  and they establish their salah  pay their zakah  then their blood and property will be free from me  except through islamic law  so the blood of the kaffir is only protected when he becomes a muslim  and while he is protected by a covenant treaty  i believe the muslims must have baraa   dissociation  from shirk and its people  but they should be made to live under the rule of islam and if they refuse they are to be fought  and the muslims must fight the mushrikeen until this deen belongs solely to allah  as commanded in his noble qur an  i am not harsh with the muslims and soft with the kuffar  rather i strive to be soft and understanding to my brothers of tawheed and the sunnah  and stern against the disbelievers  yet i am still nice to them when it comes to da wah  as that is how i am naturally  and how the muslim should be  he should not be harsh to the extent where there exists no justice  but neither should he be soft and allow himself to be humiliated in the face of the kuffar  so    am i a kharaji  you tell me   lol  if you believe i am  then by allah you either do not know the usool of the madhab of the khawarij  of you have been misinformed by the  ulama you take your deen from  in that case  anyone who thinks i m a

2013-November-09_10_4,i fail to understand how  the israeli soldier wearing his bullet proof vest  and his steel helmet  cowering behind the pile of sand bags and still runs away from the stones thrown by palestinian children is courageous  while the palestinian children charging at the soldiers full speed  armed with nothing but rocks and wearing nothing but trousers and t shirts are cowards  i fail to understand that and the american  heroic  soldiers  fighting from the comfort of their armored bradlees and strikers but nevertheless boiling inside layers of bullet proof gear in the boiling heat of the iraqi summer  are  courageous  while the iraqi mujahideen armed with nothing but the light weapons of guerilla war fare are  cowards   and what i really fail to understand  is how can the martyr  the shaheed  who willingly and happily  hands over his soul to allah  who walks towards his faith  with pleasure  and faces death with a smile  what i fail to understand is how can you call such a person a  coward  but that is what they have been called  and that is what the parrots in the muslim world have been repeating  that these people are cowards
2013-November-09_9_10,syria is not dar ul harb  not all of it anyway  if a sisters parents allow her to marry and the husband agrees to migrate then she should try to get the parents to allow her to marry sooner rather than later  hijrah is allowed without a mahram  but marrying without the permission of the wali is not  so a sister should try to do things so her parents agree and she is safe and has a husband  that is the best option for her  and if the wali refuses to give permission then you need a qadhi to rule on the matter  but i urge the sisters to firstly get their parents to agree  lest any fitnah or difficulties arise later
2013-November-09_9_11,mullah umar is a great mujahid and leader  however he is not from the tribe of quraysh  nor did he ask the people to accept him as the khalifah  therefore he continues as the leader of the taliban and the islamic state of afghanistan and we look forward to him giving the bay ah to abu bakr al baghdadi who is the legitimate khalifah

2013-November-09_9_13, congratulations o ummah of muhammad  the promise of allah has been fulfilled  after having falling into the darkness of tyranny  the khilafah has been reestablished upon the methodology of prophethood  amir ul mu mineen  abu bakr al baghdadi al husayni al qurashi  the leader of the believers whom the people are giving the bay ah to  and who fulfills the requirements for the role of the khalifah has established the rule of allah in iraq and sham  and the believers are gaining ground in fighting the disbelievers and raising the flag of tawhid  the ummah had gone many long years without the establishment of the islamic state on earth  and the office of the khilafah was absent  now it is evident to all who are aware of the islamic rulings regarding the khilafah that a noble man has fulfilled the position of the leader of the believers  following the way of abu bakr as sideeq before him  abu bakr al baghdadi as the leader of the islamic state has control over many cities in iraq and sham  and this is more than sufficient to be called the islamic state as abdullah bin zubayr in the past ruled over only the   cities of makkah and madinah yet was the legitimate khalifah  and so the control over these large areas and many cities in iraq and sham undoubtedly constitutes a state that we call the islamic state  he is from the tribe of quraysh to whom the office of the khilafah belongs  he is a muslim  he is mature  able and intelligent  he rules over the believers in his land and is not weak or incapable  those who know him speak well of him and give him the bay ah  so too we as believers are obliged to give the bay ah to the one who fulfills the conditions of being the khalifah of the muslims  as the prophet said  the one who dies without having given the bay ah dies a death of the days of jahiliyyah  rejoice o believers  for the khilafah has returned  it is incumbent upon us therefore to pledge our allegiance  to support the islamic state as it begins to grow and in its fight against the disbelievers and hypocrites who wish to attack it and return us to the days of tyranny  it is incumbent upon us to support our amir  to support our state  to support our ummah  and to hasten to be part of this blessed state     brother musa cerantonio

2013-November-13_8_15,anonymous asked  opinion on dammaj  ansarul tawheed deactivated      there is much to say in this regard  sheikh nabeel al awadhi exposes this very well  when dammaj was attacked last year  this was a slap in the face of the madakhilah  no jihaad in iraq  afghanistan  nor any of the invaded lands  but when it hits their door steps  they yell it s obligation  they could not go against their own principles  and in that they must be fighting under the banner of wali ul amr  yet they did not find under any banner with the permission of their  ruler   the situation makes the murji ah look even more silly seeking to be under the banner f the  government   when the yemeni government itself do not suppress these rawafid  rather at times they have also asissted them   generally   hence why i came across online of the du at there declared jihad against the government  because they do nothing to help the salafis and merely sit back  which is absurd to believe because their whole movement is based upon defending the tawagheet  not rising against them  and those who do are khawarij  as they claim  the mujahidin of aq came to their aid  yet they were stabbed in the back  yahya al hajoore  invited  but told them not to be fighting under  aq   but rather just as individuals  some of the brothers of aq complained that these are the same people that call them khawarij  and that is the reality of the madkhalis  perhaps they will ask for an open hand in times of fitnah  but once that is repelled  they are back to their old ways  it was recently reported that one of the  salafis  called on the people to rebel against the government  although in their distorted  aqidah the one who calls for rebellion or rebels is a kharijee  it is times like these that exposes the true nifaq of the muriji ah  is  salafi  blood more valuable then the blood of other muslims   khayr  i ask allah to make it easy for them and allow them to come to the truth  i read on a forum quoting ansarforums  well known to be mujahideen forums   aq commander abu hafs al yafee said that yahya al hajooree disallowed aq from fighting publicly because of political pressures  he said that there was no problem for aq to fight alongside those in dammaj as long as they don t use the banner of aq  and it stated that yahya himself asked aq commander to bring the mujahideen to help them  when the aq commander complained to him that his students  yahyas  label them as khawarij  yahya scolded his students and said not to speak about these issues  the brothers  in dammaj  are all knowledge  which is great  learning  aqidah  quran  hadith  although their murji tendencies are known  the result of being attacked and being exposed to being attacked is a result of neglecting the very command of allah   and prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of allah and your enemy and others besides them          when jihad is fard al  ayn  whatever is required to fulfil this wajib also becomes wajib  but of course  no jihad exists on the earth today unless it hits their own doors  like it did in dammaj and jihad was declared  i thought also mention  i came across another stupid statement by a brother who is very actively propagating the  salafi manhaj  lol  that those in dammaj didn t ask for help from aq  the khawarij  nor do they want help from them  because innovators are not to be sought help from but banished at all times  this was as ignorant as it gets  it shows the real lack of understanding of these madakhilah in matters of jihad  imaam muhammad bin al hasan al shaybani said   there is no problem for righteous muslims to fight alongside khawarij against mushrikeen   and it s narrated from  ali that he said about khawarij  we will not hinder you from taking from what you earned in jihaad and imaam as sarakhsi commented on these words  it proves that if khawaarij fight against disbelievers under the banner of righteous muslims  they deserve their share from the booty as the others deserve  because they are muslims     al mabsut              imaam ibn taymiyyah said in  majmu al fatawa           if establishing the obligations such as education  jihaad and other obligations besides that becomes impossible except with the help of one who has bid a and its harms are less than the harms of leaving the obligation  so obtaining the interest of the obligation   even if it has some evil as a result   is better than the opposite of this  i e  abandoning ahlul bid a   my main points     the nifaq exposed in regards to this event from the first time they were attacked  no jihad in iraq  no jihad in afghanistan  yet it when it comes to their doors  jihad is yelled     although some of them were playing around desiring to somehow show the people they have permission from the  ruler   not any of the salaf or the classical ulama has stated that permission from the ruler is a set condition for jihad  rather the ulama have stated for offensive  it is makruh without his permission  and defensive  not any single scholar has stipulated this as a condition  it is no surprise that the murji ah come with this bid ah of there is no jihad without a ruler  as the movement itself lives off protecting their rulers     yahya al hajooree asked aq for help  on the condition they do not fight under the banner of aq    the result of such an outcome to be exposed to attacks  is due to neglecting the command of allah to prepare militarily     it is permissible to seek aid from the khawarij against the kuffar  in fact  it has also been stated they have their rights to war booty  what does this have to do with the post  it s for those ignorants who believe seeking help from the khawarij against the kuffar is haram  and it is for the bigger fools that claim aq are khawarij  it shows they know nothing about the madhab of the khawarij  nor the aqidah of aq  if we were to state  rebelling against the ruler   although its fard when he  ruler  disbelieves  renders one a kharaji  this would necessitate some of the salaf to be khawarij  and we seek refuge from allah from such ignorance and misguided rhetoric  regardless  may allah aid the brothers in dammaj and guide them to the correct manhaj  and may he give victory to all the mujahideen on the  ardh   there is much to say in this regard  sheikh nabeel al awadhi exposes this very well  when dammaj was attacked last year  this was a slap in the face of the madakhilah  no jihaad in iraq  afghanistan

even if it has some evil as a result   is better than the opposite of this  i e  abandoning ahlul bid a   my main points     the nifaq exposed in regards to this event from the first time they were attacked  no jihad in iraq  no jihad in afghanistan  yet it when it comes to their doors  jihad is yelled     although some of them were playing around desiring to somehow show the people they have permission from the  ruler   not any of the salaf or the classical ulama has stated that permission from the ruler is a set condition for jihad  rather the ulama have stated for offensive  it is makruh without his permission  and defensive  not any single scholar has stipulated this as a condition  it is no surprise that the murji ah come with this bid ah of there is no jihad without a ruler  as the movement itself lives off protecting their rulers     yahya al hajooree asked aq for help  on the condition they do not fight under the banner of aq    the result of such an outcome to be exposed to attacks  is due to neglecting the command of allah to prepare militarily     it is permissible to seek aid from the khawarij against the kuffar  in fact  it has also been stated they have their rights to war booty  what does this have to do with the post  it s for those ignorants who believe seeking help from the khawarij against the kuffar is haram  and it is for the bigger fools that claim aq are khawarij  it shows they know nothing about the madhab of the khawarij  nor the aqidah of aq  if we were to state  rebelling against the ruler   although its fard when he  ruler  disbelieves  renders one a kharaji  this would necessitate some of the salaf to be khawarij  and we seek refuge from allah from such ignorance and misguided rhetoric  regardless  may allah aid the brothers in dammaj and guide them to the correct manhaj  and may he give victory to all the mujahideen on the  ardh

2013-November-29_7_10,this is the essence of monotheism  tawhid   that you abandon all else and flee to allah  flight is from something to something else  and in this case it is from whatever is odious in the sight of allah to whatever he loves  this is essentially an expression of either love or revulsion  whoever flees a thing exchanges an undesirable thing for something better  in response to his own preference  this kind of migration may be more or less strongly motivated depending upon the degree of love in one s heart  the stronger or deeper the love  the more complete and secure is the migration  if this love is shallow then the migration is less secure  and this may continue to the point of complete indifference
2013-November-29_7_11,hijrah has a comprehensive meaning as understood in islam  it is not simply just the act of moving from one place to another  from a non muslim country to a muslim country  ibn al qayyim explains that it is  in fact  an emigration of the body and the spirit  a physical movement from one place to another and a spiritual migration to allah and his messenger  peace be upon him   it is this second migration which constitutes the real migration  as the body simply follows the soul  thus  the meaning of moving from one thing to something else is that the heart moves from the love of something other than allah to love of allah  from servitude of something or other to the service and worship of allah  from fear of something or other to hope in and reliance upon allah  it is allah who is the object of one s hope and fear  prayers are addressed to him  and he is the one before whom one feels humility and awe  this is the meaning of flight which allah mentions in the command   so flee to allah

2013-October-25_17_15,it has been narrated on the authority of anas b  malik who said  on the day of ubud some of the people  being defeated  left the holy prophet  may peace he upon him   but abu talha stood before him covering him with a shield  abu talha was a powerful archer who broke two or three bows that day  when a man would pass by carrying a quiver containing arrows  he would say  spare them for abu talha  whenever the holy prophet  way peace be upon him  raised his head to look at the people  abd talba would say  prophet of allah  may my father and my mother be thy ransom  do not raise your head lest you be struck by an arrow shot by the enemy  my neck is before your neck  the narrator said  i saw a isha bint abu bakr and umm sulaim  both of them had tucked up their garments  so i could me the anklets on their feet  they were carrying water skins on their backs and would pour water into the mouths of the people  they would then go back  to the well   would fill them again and would return to pour water into the mouths of the soldiers   on this day   abu talha s sword dropped down from his hands twice or thrice because of drowsiness
2013-October-26_17_10,    and i often find that people supplicate with certain prayers and have their prayers answered  and they couple their supplication with their neediness and turning towards allah  or a good deed they carried out that caused allah to respond to this supplication out of gratitude for this good deed  or they happened to supplicate at a time in which it is more likely to be accepted  etc  so  his supplication was answered because of this  one might think that the secret was in the specific wording of his supplication  and might therefore approach it simply from this angle while ignoring all of these other things that were coupled with it by the person supplicating  this is like someone who uses beneficial medicine at its proper time and in the proper manner and it benefits him as a result  and someone else thinks that simply using this medicine regardless of these other factors will bring about the same benefit  this person is wrong  and this is where many people fall into error  an example of this is when a needy person supplicates near a grave  so  the ignorant one thinks that the secret of his supplication being answered lies in this grave  and he doesn t know that the real secret is in his neediness and full dependence on allah  so  if this happens in a house from the houses of allah  this would be better and more beloved to allah  and supplications and prayers of refuge are like weapons  and a weapon is only as effective as the one using it  not just based on how sharp it is  so  as perfect and flawless a weapon is  as strong as the arm is that is using it  as much as there is nothing to nullify its effectiveness   the more damaging it will be against the enemy  and whenever one of these three elements is absent  the effect will be held back  so  if the supplication itself is not good  or the one supplicating does not have both his heart and tongue present when making it  or there is some element present to prevent it from being answered  it will have no effect       ad da  wad dawa    p

2014-April-03_5_12,the history of this conflict does not go back to    september       nor does it go back to the bombing of a few embassies and ships  rather  it goes back centuries from the time when the jewish tribes gathered against the prophet muhammad  saws  and the christians launched the crusades against the muslims in the   th century of the christian era  therefore  it is not a case of  let s all join hands  muslims  christians and jews and wipe out terrorism   but it is part of a deeper plot to try and destroy islam in the world  why did the british invade afghanistan in       when there was neither an usama bin ladin   nor the taliban

2014-April-09_5_5,assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu  before i even start writing this i want to state that allah knows my intentions but i am in no way at all boasting or bragging on about the position i have been blessed with out of the mercy of allah  and i am in no way demeaning those who haven t yet embarked upon this journey and most importantly i am not at all deterring sisters from choosing this path   i just want to paint a realistic picture of what is in store for the sisters here  i just ask my beloved sisters to take the sincere advice i will give them into consideration if they fear allah  bismillah first and foremost i will try and answer the commom questions sisters ask me regarding hijrah and the life in syria for the muhajirat     many sisters ask me to give them a list of what they should bring with them from the west and what they will need here  there are many materialistic things that can be found here however it is better for you to bring clothes  shoes etc from the west  there are clothes here  but wallahi the quality is really bad  it s a miracle if you find a top or trousers which last longer than a month  so bring all your clothing from socks and underwear to dresses and hijaab  the biggest mistake i made was not bringing enough jilbabs and niqaab because i presumed i may be able to find islamic clothing here but honestly that is next to impossible   not to mention how the syrians view of hijab is a complete joke  the abayas are skin tight and their niqaab starts from their forehead and ends at their nostrils  i wish i was exaggerating but unfortunately i m really not  may allah protect us    so sisters please try and bring your   layer niqaabs  jilbabs and khimars from back home   try ordering them online perhaps if you cannot find them around your local shops  the shoes here are also bad quality  in addition they only seem to have   sizes here lol so maybe bring a pair of trainers with you  for the winter you will most likely need a good pair of boots and a thick warm coat  the winters here are freezing  trust me i m from north of britain and even still i found it cold  you can find shampoos soaps and other female necessities here  so do not stress if you think you will be experiencing some cavewomen life here  alhumdulilaah i have experienced far too much luxury than i was expecting  deen wise please do remember to bring all your kitaabs and download as many pdfs as you can on your tablets and mobiles  be careful to not make them too jihadi as you also have to tie your camel   and all precations must be taken not to bait yourself out  wallahi these kuffar and munafiqeen will do anything to cause the muslimeen harm  but they plot and plan however allah is the best of planners   it is very difficult to download lectures or books here unless you have a   star internet connection  allahumma baarik lol  which is very rare here  so unfortunately we mostly depend on bluetoothing to one another  you will have too much free time here so if anything this can be a huge fitnah if not used correctly  read the quran  study the seerahs and aqeedah  it s so important to keep seeking knowledge  and lastly for the married sisters or soon to be married  bring makeup and jewellery from the west because trust me there is absolutely nothing here    unless you plan on looking like a clown ting  haha i know somethings sound very tedious and not necessary but you will thank me later  plus i m just trying my best to give as detailed a list as i can     before making hijrah there are many ways one can try and prepare themselves for what is in store  to live a completely different kind of life means completely changing your outlook on life and researching as much you want until you feel content with what you are about to do and know it is right  to sisters  don t take the big commitment and step of leaving daar ul kufr if you still are in doubt wether it is wajib or not  or wether it will be harram on you for leaving without a mahram or not  you will not enjoy your hijrah truly until you believe from the bottom of your heart it is to please allah  and most importantly you need to be sincere in your intentions  if you are still in doubt then research until you are content  however do not keep using this as an excuse to stay back from the land of jihad  and allah knows what is hidden in the hearts  wallahi the most beautiful part of hijrah is making it away from your sins and nafs before physically making hijrah away from darul kufr  there are many ways to prepare yourself mentally  emotionally and physically    mentally you need to gain closeness to allah  this is very important  you need to pray istikhara and try and spend your nights seeking counsel from the most wise  why would allah guide us towards something that is not khayr for you  and most importantly attach yourself to the book of allah and wallahi you will find all the answers to your doubts and worries in their  you are doing all this purely for the sake of allah and no other reason than this  your hijrah is for his sake and you do not fear the blame of the blamers    emotionally you will face many obstacles  from family to your everyday habits  i remember i thought i would be living in a camp in the middle of the dessert so i tried my best to cut down on my favourite foods and use very little water thus preventing wastage  haha i find it very funny now when i look back  but to be honest all of this really helps to lower your expectations on life and accept whatever comes your way as a blessing from allah  and personally an important step for me was trying to distance myself from my family as much as i could  while still fulfilling your fardh towards them  this was crucial for myself as i didn t and still don t trust my stubborn heart  everything is always easier said than done and leaving my family for the sake of allah was the biggest sacrifice i ve ever made in my selfish life so far  i ask you all to make duaa that allah accepts from me this hijrah and keeps me sincere to him always    physical preparation is something that most muhajireen   including myself   missed out on due to impatience  haste and excitement  haha and what i mean by that is making sure you visit the gp and get all the shots and vaccinations that you require  you are travelling half way across the world and your immune system will most likely be in for a shock  you will regret if you don t do this since the health care here is funny  the way it works here is that they just keep prescribing you with everything and anything    try and bring painkillers and diahorea tablets    lol you will need it for the first month or so  and have trust in allah  always     a normal day for a muhajirah revolves around the same duties as a normal housewife   at the moment i m living at a sisters makar  headquarters base  along with many other sisters in raqqah  since the situation with the muhajireen has been unsettling since the fighting with fsa in halab broke out   resulting in many of us having to leave our homes  for the time being we are being housed and taken care of here until our husbands find us a house inshaaallah  anyways  your day will revolve around cooking  cleaning  looking after and sometimes even educating the children  haha i didn t even know how to cook when i got married    months ago  but now i ve had so much free time that i ve learnt    trust me sisters  practice makes perfect   you can have electricity most of the time or you can rarely have it   it just depends upon your circumstance   but you have to be prepared for not having your mobile charged or their not being light  alhumdulilah for battery powered lights and candles  and maybe even learn how to wash your clothes by hand since you really cannot depend on the washing machine here  it may seem hard or very difficult but it is actually a lot easier than it sounds  plus it s so very easy to adjust to the life here  moreever you have a lot of time to seek out knowledge and hifz quran  and when your husband has free time then he can take you out to practice shooting etc  in addition if your husband gives you permission then you can go to the internet cafe with a group of sisters or the market if you need anything  wallahi it really just depends on how you want to utilise your time  it is very easy to get distracted and waste time here  it s sunnah to have a laugh and enjoy the company of your friends  but be careful not to invite shaytan in and adopt the silly habit of backbiting and ill talk  all advice to myself first and foremost  last but not least  as mundane as some of the day to day tasks may get  still you truly value every minute here for the sake of allah  if you know the blessings of this land and those residing in it then you can be placed into the worst of situations and chores here and you will still find those rare people who will have a huge smile on their face simply because their intentions are to please allah and they feel blessed to be placed in this situation out of the billions of muslims around the world  wallahi i have come across such beautiful sisters who will spend mornings and nights in happiness because they are cooking the mujahideen food or they ll clean the whole building without anyone even figuring it out who it was  wallahi you ll wake up in the morning and the whole makar had been sparkly cleaned after fajr  subhanallah one day after fajr i was heading to the roof to try and contact family and catch signal until i saw an old chechan women   much older than my own mother   cleaning the upstairs and downstairs with a cloth in her hand and on her knees swiping the staircases  you know people say you can see by someone s face whom allah loves and by allah i am not exaggerating but this women has so much noor on her face  its so beautiful  may allah bless her  sisters truly need to adpot this mentality and not see any work around the house even if its not for your own self as useless and annoying  don t forget you make hijrah for a selfless reason  once you get here don t ruin it for selfish motives  may allah grant us all ikhlas in all that we do     housing is provided by doula  if you are married then you will be given a house  however if you are still to get married then most likely you will stay at a friends house or at a sisters makar  headquarters   also  until you get given a house from doula  since there is a waiting que  you will most likely stay at the sisters makar while your husband will be with the brothers  at this makar you are provided with everything alhumdulilaah  from food  water  heat  visits to doctors and sometimes even to the market accompanied by the ameer etc  i have stressed this before on twitter but i really need sisters to stop dreaming about coming to shaam and not getting married  wallahi life here is very difficult for the muhajirat and we depend heavily on the brothers for a lot of support  it is not like the west where you can casually walk out and go to asda walmart and drive back home    even till now we have to stay safe outside and must always be accompanied by a mahram  even though we are living in land which is under the control of doula  there are still a lot of munafiqeen roaming the streets openly  unless of course if you have family here  if your father or brother is here then it is a different situation  regardless  it s most appropriate and better for the sisters to get married sooner  i have come across online many sisters who want to make hijrah but are living in a day dream where they expect to live with you and your husband    lol there s only so long one is treated like a guest and until your morals kick in and you realise how much of a burden you are upon people  sisters please do not listen to any sources online which give false information where doula is openly encouraging and supporting sisters to make hijrah and never getting married  there is no housing for  single muhajirat     it is just a place where someone may allow you to reside in feesaabeelilah till you get married  this is some thing i have enquired with the umarah personally  even the shuhadah house  where the sisters who s husbands have become shaheed   inshaallah   stay  encourage the sisters once their iddah is finished to get remarried  the reality is that to stay without a man here is really difficult  i know some brothers online are helping sisters make hijrah feesaabeelilah  and taking care of their housing  may allah reward them for their intentions  my advice to the sisters is to try and limit their communication with the brothers here  most of the brothers who the sisters are constantly getting in touch with are already married and others who really don t want to be free mixing  try and talk to the sisters before having to resort to getting help elsewhere  its completely understandable though  it s much more difficult for the sisters to get internet and for the brothers its easier and it is probably why they are online and able to reply to your queries much more  alhumdulilaah  the less internet you have the more time you have to use feesaabeelilah     jihad  ok  so this is one of the most common and hyped up questions i have been receiving from sisters who are intending on making hijrah beithnillah  i will be straight up and blunt with you all  there is absolutely nothing for sisters to participate in qitaal  sheikh omar shishani has been quite clear on his answer and has emphasized that there is nothing for sisters as of yet  no amalia istishihadiya  martyrdom operations  or a secret sisters katiba  these are all rumours you may have heard through some sources who themselves are not actually aware of the truth  and the women you may have seen online participating are all part of a propaganda  the women in the video are part of secularist groups who are not calling for the law of allah  please sisters do not believe anything you hear or see online where apparently sisters are fighting feesaabeelilah  for the time being qitaal is not fardh ayn upon the sisters  we have plenty brothers who don t even get selected on going on operations  the brothers get upset and start crying since they want to participate  so what does that make you think  for the sisters its completely impossible for the now  inshaaallah in future  and this brings me onto my second point where once i tell this to sisters they have no more intention on coming here anymore    subhanallah  hijrah is not just for jihad but also with the intention of living honourably under the law of shariah  always renew your intentions  what makes you think that you will come here and not contribute at all towards also raising the flag of laillaha ilalah just as the brothers from the mujahideen are also doing  our role is even more important as women in islam  since if we don t have sisters with the correct aqeedah and understanding who are willing to sacrifice all their desires and give up their families and lives in the west in order to make hijrah and please allah  then who will raise the next generation of lions  sister s don t forsake this beautiful blessing being able to raise the future mujahideen of shaam  and making them a part of the hadith where the best of people will be in shaam  how can you not want to leave behind offspring who may by the will of allah be a part of the great islamic revival  imagine raising a son and he participates in the al malahem  or having a grandson who is a part of the army of the mahdi  always think of everything you do to be purely for the sake of allah and you will find a contentness in your heart like no other  wallahi sisters our role is more important than any other  and even the brothers know they are not as capable and as strong as a women is created to be  it is a part of our fitrah to be wives and mothers  and we are not created like man  wallahi from the bottom of my heart i completely understand your desires and craving to participate in the battlefield and give away your blood feesaabeelilah but i will share with you a piece of advice which truly helped me     ok  so lets think about the   greatest women in islam  it wasn t ayesha  ra  who was the most knowledgeable female in islam  so straight away we know that having much ilm is not what makes a women great  it wasn t nusaybah  or umm sulaym or al khansa    ra     who are well known for their participation in qital feesaabeelilah  therefore a womens role as a mujahidah isn t what makes her great nor is it what they were created for  the   greatest women in islam   khadeejah  asia  fatimah and maryam  so we as muslim females should view these women as our role models as these were the most blessed in the sight of allah  so what did these females all have in common  what was it that made them so special  what made them so unique was that they raised the best of men  they raised true slaves of allah  their role as mothers were so important since their upbringing resulted in the future of their child   through which they gained countless ajr  and secondly their role as obedient wives is also an important factor  and that is the reality my dear sisters  we are created to be mothers and wives   as much as the western society has warped your views on this with a hidden feminist mentality  allahu  llam  you may gain more ajr by spending years of sleepless nights by being a mother and raising your children with the right intentions and for the sake of allah than by doing a martyrdom operation  wallahi it completely depends on your intentions  may allah accept our efforts and grant us pious offspring who will act as a means of sadqah jariah and a means of shafa a  and that is the reality of the life here for the sisters  i urge all my sisters to come and gain true honour by living under the law of shariah  by marrying a brother who puts allah before his desires and by being in the forefront of this islamic revival  wallahi there is nothing more sad than sitting in the sidelines  keep your intentions sincere and don t let shaytan tempt you or make excuses for you to stay back from the land of izzah   allahu akbar  i finally finished typing this post which i had been promising since the first week i arrived in shaam   which was more than   months ago haha  anyways update is that i am no longer in the makar anymore  alhumdulilah we have a house now in manbij  i have tried my best to answer most queries and advise my sisters as much as i could but if you still anything more i should touxh up on and write about then please message me on tumblr  tweet me  ummlayth  or kik me   axa   please keep my husband  the brothers here and all the muhajirat in your duaas  and may allah forgive me for any wrong which i may have said  i am merely a sinful servant of allah  please forgive me for my shortcomings

2014-June-03_4_1,assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu  the topic i am briefly going to type up is regarding family and some of the trials one will have to go through regarding them  the biggest fitnah once you arrive in the land of jihad is your family  some people assume it will be easy  family will disown them and want nothing to do with them    if only it was as easy as that  leaving your family behind for the sake of allah is a big enough fitnah to handle  but realistically that is the smallest hurdle you will face along this blessed path involving your family  wallahi preparing yourself to leave is difficult because you are leaving the women who kept you in her womb for   months  who breastfed you  who stayed up till night taking care of each and every one of your needs and the person who you truly feel at home with  even if you know how right this path and decision is and how your love for allah comes before anything and everything  this is still an ache which only one who has been through and experienced it can understand  the first phone call you make once you cross the borders is one of the most difficult things you will ever have to do  your parents are already worried enough over where you are  wether you are okay and what s happened  how does a parent who has little islamic knowledge and understanding comprehend why their son or daughter has left their well off life  education and a bright future behind to go live in a war torn country  most likely they will blame themselves  they will think they have done something  but until they truly understand from the bottom of their heart that you have done this action sincerely for allah s sake they will live in hope that you will return  they might assume this is a  phase  you are going through or a huge mistake you have made  i know of people who have been here in shaam for over   years and their parents still try to persuade them to come back and live in false hope  make duaa that allaah makes it easy for your parents to understand and accept your hijrah feesabeelilah  sometimes it would be easier for you to accept your parents disowning you and wanting nothing to do with you  however when you hear them sob and beg like crazy on the phone for you to come back it s so hard  wallahi it s so hard to hear this and i can never do justice to how cold hearted you feel  but as long as you are firm and you know that this is all for the sake of allah then nothing can shake you inshaallaah  many people are using their parents as an excuse to stay back from making their feet dusty and would rather live in dishonour amongst the kuffar  there is no way you can make this easier for your parents  your parents will be hurt  you will be judged and viewed by society and it will not matter an inch to you as you know the say of allah is greater than that of all mankind put together    sister s a little note  many people in present day do not understand and cannot comprehend at all why a female would choose to make this decision  they will point fingers and say behind your back and to your families faces that you are taking part in  jihadul nikaah  or  sexual jihad  and many many more vile terms  it hurts because these words will come from perhaps some of your closest relatives  hasbunallahu wa ni maal wakeel  i cannot emphasise enough how important it is to keep making dua  wallahi i am witness to how allah  swt  turned the heart of my parents  my own father was more than happy to be my wali for my nikaah when he at first did not accept my decision  alhumdulilaah walakul hamd  once you are travelling to shaam making continuous dua as allah  swt  always accepts the dua of a musafir ah  i am aware of many sisters whose parents were completely against her hijrah and disowned her in the beginning whom now are making plans to come visit them and visit this beautiful land  so do not think it will be last time you will see your beloved parents  maybe allah has a better plan for the future  i ask you all to keep me  my husband  my family and all the muhajireen in your duaa  apologies for the delay in uploading the post  but wallahi it s so difficult to try and find time off due to a busy timetable  alhumdulilaah  if you need to contact me then follow me on twitter    ummlayth  or kik me   axa     imaam muslim reported in his saheeh from the hadeeth of abu hurairah  radyallaahu  anhu  that the prophet  sallallaahu  alayhi wa sallam  said   islaam began as something strange and it will return to being strange as it began  so toobaa is for the strangers    saheeh muslim          see sharh saheeh muslim of imaam an nawawee              imaam ahmad and ibn maajah have also reported this hadeeth on the authority of ibn mas ood  radyallaahu  anhu  with the addition at the end of it   it was said   o messenger of allaah  and who are the strangers   he  sallallaahu  alayhi wa sallam  said   the nuzaa   those who extract themselves  from their families and close relatives      sunan ibn maajah  no         sunan at tirmidhee        and he said it was authentic     allaah does not burden a soul with more than it can handle    surah al baqarah

2014-March-01_6_5,shaykh muhammad nasir ad din al albani  commenting on the hadith of the messenger of allah  peace be upon him    indeed  all of you  if you bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but allah  perform the prayer  pay the zakah  separate yourselves from the polytheists  give the fifth of the war booty and the share for the prophet and what he selects from the war booty before it is distributed  you are safe with the protection of allah and the protection of his messenger   shaykh al albani commented  saying   and indeed  from that which is to be extremely saddened about is that those who embrace islam in this present time period   despite their large number  and all praise is due to allah   they don t conform with this ruling of separating themselves and migrating to the lands of islam except for a small portion of them  and i trace the reason for that back to two matters  the first is their greed for the dunya and the easy means of living and luxury in their lands resulting from their living a materialistic life of joy that has no spirituality in it  as is well known  so  it is usually difficult for them to move to an islamic land in which the means of a decent life may not be sufficient for them  in their viewpoint  the second   and it is more significant   is their ignorance of this ruling  and they are excused in that  because they do not hear anything regarding it from any of the callers whose words are publicized and translated into some of the foreign languages  nor do they hear it from those who go to them in the name of da wah  because most of them are not knowledgeable in the rulings of islam   rather  they cling more to their lands when they see many of the muslims reversing the ruling by leaving their lands and going to the lands of disbelief  so  from where are those people whom allah guided to islam going to know the likes of this ruling while the muslims themselves are acting contrary to it  indeed  let these people and those people know that hijrah continues to exist just like jihad  for he has said   hijrah does not cease as long as the enemy is fought   and in another hadith   hijrah will not cease until repentance ceases  and repentance will not cease until the sun rises from the west     taken from  silsilat al ahadith as sahihah   commentary to hadith

2014-March-01_6_7,one visit to the lands of jihaad  by the help of allaah ta ala  will be sufficient to transform any muslim into a mountain of enthusiasm and courage  so much so that he will keep shahaadat and jihaad in mind   in his sleep and wakefulness
2014-March-01_6_8,will the muslims wake up  will they take heed  do they not see that they are put into trials every year  once or twice  then too they do not make taubah turn unto allaah ta  ala and they do not take a lesson  let all those who have the means and strength know that jihaad is binding upon them  and each muslim should do his share in this field  according to his ability  and allaah ta ala has not made anyone responsible except for that which is within his ability
2014-March-01_6_9,the life of jihaad is based on toil and exertion  on sweat  blood  tiredness  sleeplessness  difficulties and pain  jihaad is built on the human flesh that has to be burnt so that the flame of jihaad may stay alight  just as oil has to burn to keep a lamp alight  jihaad binges on grief and fear  the flowing of the blood of the innocent shuhadaa and scattering of corpses are all  complementary to jihaad  all these are the fuel of jihaad  and water for its garden

2014-May-13_4_4,storiesofthesahabah  feeling ungrateful to your mother  are you too irritated to her nonstop talking and asking about you  you feel like just shutting your door and stop her from

because i miss my mother  and i want this to be a reminder to all of you  to recognize the worth and value of your mother  because once you lose her  nothing will be the same again  while most of you can still see your mother s smile  i cannot anymore  while most of you can still put your head on your mom s shoulder  i cannot anymore  while most of you can still call out to your mother when you feel pain in your body  i cannot anymore  while most of you can still go and have that heart to heart talk with your mother  i cannot anymore  it s been more than a year since she returned to allaah

truly describe the pain of losing a mother  even i who lost her own  i still cannot describe and put into words the pain i go through everyday of my life  my dear brother and sister in islam  in our deen we are taught on how high of a status a mother has  how she must be respected and how she should be taken care of  but sometimes you don t need any other reason why these things should be done

you read this  go look at her  look at her face  run your fingers on her face  look at her beautiful eyes  then kiss her on his forehead and say you re sorry  and i tell you in second  you will see your mother in tears  not because you have committed something  but because she will feel understood  cared  loved and all these feelings she needs to feel from you  why did i say sorry  because apologizing is harder than loving  we can say i love you to almost everyone we feel like to  but i m sorry  we can only truly say that to people who means a lot to us  to people who we think deserves it most  and your mother is most worthy of your apology  apologizing doesn t mean you are wrong or you have done something wrong  apologizing means that you are afraid to lose this person  to hurt this person  to not able to live up to what this person expects from you  with i m sorry  there is the light of unconditional love and understanding  your mother deserves that  because you know for a fact that in a day when she calls you  you return her call with the  uff   i want you to realize how much struggle and pain your mother underwent when she was carrying you and when she finally delivered you to this dunya  not even a single labor pain of hers can be repaid by your lifetime service to her  she is your mother  no one else can be you mother  only her  let no one go beyond her status in your heart  because no one will love you like the way your mother would ever do  i have lost my mother but every moment i spent with her were the best moments of my life  so you  spend your days with your mother  make her smile  let her be pleased with you because she is one of your doors to jannah  do not be too careless that you will just realize all of these on the day you see her being buried in her grave and i tell you when you see your mother shrouded in white cloth and being buried in her grave  that is the most painful thing  your heart will be in so much pain that you ll just pass out  in that moment  you could finally say that she has truly left  that later on she will be alone and be questioned and no one can help her not even you  only her and her deeds  wallahi  we pray our mothers be granted jannah  amin  so yes  my mother has left me already but alhamdulillaah she left me at the doorstep of allaah azza wa jall  alhamdulillaah alhamdulillaah alhamdulillaah

2014-November-24_3_5,and ibn al qayyim confirmed a principle saying that the human being  if his righteous deeds and benefit in the society are a lot  then he is forgiven for things that others might not be forgiven for  and mistakes of his may be overlooked that would not be overlooked for others  because the messenger of allaah said   if water reaches two qullahs  measuring unit   then it will not become impure by impurity   so a large volume of water  if some small impurity falls into it  does not have its purity affected  and it can still be used for ablution and bathing  likewise  the human being  if his good deeds are many  then one turns a blind eye to some of his bad deeds that are drowned in his ocean of good deeds
2014-November-24_3_6,sayyid qutb  rahimahullah  said   to flee from battle deserves such condemnation because of the magnitude of its serious consequences on the one hand  and because it has a bearing on the very question of having faith  a believer should be firm and resolute  able to resist any force on earth  since he believes that allaah s power can overcome all powers  if a believer s heart experiences a tremor at a moment of danger  such a tremor should not go as far as making him flee from battle  the moment of anyone s death is determined by allaah alone  hence  no believer may flee from battle fearing for his life  this should not constitute too much of a burden for anyone  a believer is a human being who encounters an enemy  who  in turn  is a human being  hence  they are of the same nature  the believer  however  has the advantage of relying on the overpowering might of allaah himself  moreover  he is under allaah s care while he is alive  and he entrusts himself to allaah s care if he attains martyrdom  this means that in all situations he is stronger than his enemy who defies allaah and his messenger  hence this absolute ruling   and whoever turns his back to them on such a day   unless it be a stratagem of war  or to retreat to a troop  of his own     he indeed has drawn upon himself wrath from allah  and his abode is hell  and worst indeed is that destination    fee zhilaal al quraan  english trans

2014-October-30_3_7,the weirdness of this ummah    no one wants to conduct jihad except the khawarij    no one want to strive to establish the shari ah except the khawarij    none are feared by their enemies except the khawarij    and their  khawarij ness  are proven when death has come and they die in the state of smiling
2014-September-11_3_9,assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu  first of all wallahi wallahi i know my position  i am not a scholar  a daiee or even a student of knowledge   not even close to it  so please do not assume that of me  these diary posts i write are only and only written with the intention of being a way of encouragement and advice for my sisters and brothers who are still stuck behind the walls of darul kufr  so in this post i am not just talking about myself but in general all of the muhajirat here  all words are my own   the media at first used to claim that the ones running away to join the jihad as being unsuccessful  didn t have a future and from broke down families etc  but that is far from the truth  most sisters i have come across have been in university studying courses with many promising paths  with big  happy families and friends and everything in the dunyah to persuade one to stay behind and enjoy the luxury  if we had stayed behind  we could have been blessed with it all from a relaxing and comfortable life and lots of money  wallahi that s not what we want  and in these lands we are rewarded for our sacrifices involved in our hijrah for example one is by receiving ghanimah  and know that honestly there is something so pleasurable to know that what you have has been taken off from the kuffar and handed to you personally by allah swt as a gift  some of the many things include kitchen appliances from fridges  cookers  ovens  microwaves  milkshake machines etc  hoovers and cleaning products  fans and most importantly a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the khilafah and no rent included  sounds great right  but wallahi all those who have left their luxuries behind and made sincere hijrah feesabeelilah will be taken care of in this dunyah by allah swt and given an even bigger reward in the aakhirah  may allah swt accept our hijrah  honestly a dua that we shouldn t stop making even after we arrive here  know that in this step of hijrah you will be honoured wherever you go by allah swt  and everything you had he swt will replace it with something even better from dunyah stuff and even family  the family you get in exchange for leaving the ones behind are like the pearl in comparison to the shell you threw away into the foam of the sea which is the ummah  the reason for this is because your love for one another is purely for the sake of allah  the strengh of the brotherhood and sisterhood here is most definitely shown through difficulties where someone who has no blood ties with you and not even a relation will make sure if their muslim sister is in need of anything and if there is any problems  we are seen as ruthless cold hearted youth who have no care and love for their relations whom they have left behind  where we have left our families heart broken and in danger  this image is viewed not just by the kuffar but by some muslims and even those of the correct aqeedah who do not have enough courage to make hijrah  even those very people will say  subhanallaah how can they put their family through this   authobillah  what a statement indeed  are you forgetting of all the companions who left behind all of their families when they left for madeenah  yes they were seen as traitors to their families and an epitome of betrayal to their communities  the only thing which makes one take this actions is al wala wal bara  love and hate purely for the sake of allah swt  wallahi if we are put in a position we would gladly follow the sunnahs of the likes of abu ubaydah  ra   our claim for al wala wal bara is fake if we do not externally and internally hate for the sake of allah the one who tarnishes the image of islam  the one who takes allies with the kuffar and denounces the main pillars of islam including jihad  even if this very person is the one gave birth to us or just our blood in general  wallahi in islam  there is no importance to blood ties over ties over din  being angry for the sake of allah swt is part of our islam  part of our aqeedah  part of our eeman  and part of tassawuf     you will not find any people who believe in allaah and the last day  making friendship with and loving those who oppose allaah and his messenger  even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their people    al mujaadilah          the prophet  saw  said   the best of the actions is to love for the sake of allah and to hate for the sake of allah    sunan abu dawud            all of us disassociated ourselves from our families  friends and societies  we make it known to the world that never has our allegiance been to the scottish  british  swedish  american  canadian etc     government  wallahi we are free of those living in the west who know and proclaim the shahadah while being beneath the feet of the kuffar  ittaqullah  know this cameron obama  you and your countries will be beneath our feet and your kufr will be destroyed  this is a promise from allah swt that we have no doubt over  if not you then your grandchildren or their grandchildren  but worry not  somewhere along the line your blood will be spilled by our cubs in dawlah  we have conquered these lands once beithnillah we will do it again  read up on your history  and know that it will repeat itself  you will pay jizyah to us just like you did in the past  this islamic empire shall be known and feared world wide and we will follow none other than the law of the one and the only ilah  so our answer to our passports being confiscated  wow wallahiil adheeem biggest joke of this week  the only time we will ever  ever return to those lands beithnillah is to raise our flag  my allegiance is and will only be to our beloved ameer  destroyer of the enemies  abu bakr al baghdadi  ha  and to the islamic state  my dear brothers and sisters who are stuck in the west and restrained due to the kufr governments know that indeed the help of allah swt is always near  have sabr and know that you will never be tested beyond your ability  and to those who are able and can still make your way  please ittaqillah and don t delay anymore  hasten hasten hasten to our lands and live in izzah before it is made difficult for you  know that these trialing times and do not miss out on any of the ajr  this is a war against islam and it is know that either  you re with them or with us   so pick a side    alhumdulilaah  apologies for uploading the post very late  inshaallah i will try and be more frequent with them  keep all of the muhajireen in your dua s and ask ask allah swt to unite you with us  please make duaa for a sinful servant of allah swt  that he grants me ikhlas in all that i do and that he swt out of his mercy bestows on me the honour of shahadah

2015-August-07_1_7,shamsuddeen muhammad bin abee bakr ibn qayyim aj jawzeeyah  d     a h    rahimullaah  said   if a disliked qadr crosses a person  then he has six considerations  the first  consideration is of tawheed  and that allaah is the one who destined it for him  willed it for him  created him  whatever allaah wants occurs and whatever allaah does not want does not occur  the second  consideration is of justice  and that it will occur with allaah s command  it is just in fulfilling allaah s justice  the third  consideration is of mercy  and that allah s mercy in what has been destined is generally from allaah s anger and recompense  his mercy is present but hidden and not apparent  the fourth  the consideration of wisdom  that the allaah s wisdom  subhanahu  necessitated this destiny  allaah did not destine this in vain or command it for no reason  the fifth  consideration is of praise  that all complete praise is for allaah  subhanahu  for this destined qadr from whichever way you look at it  the sixth  the consideration of servitude of worship  and that a person is purely a slave of allaah from every point of view  the regulations of his master apply to him and are carried out due to him being his master s possession and his slave  so allaah disposes him under his destined rulings just as allaah disposes him under rulings of the deen  therefore  the slave of allaah has to conform and proceed with these rulings   from  al fawaid p

2015-January-22_3_2,assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu ya akhawat  you may be a wife of a mujahid already or you may be firm that if you will marry it will be only to the one who gets his feet dusty yeah  and alhumdulilah for this  sisters with this comes the great acceptance and hefty reality which is that this decision means we will most probably have to sooner or later hear the news of our husbands success  which is his shahadah  so maybe even before his death you have spent time preparing for it emotionally  but unfortunately many are not educated on what comes next  you already knew you wanted to marry a mujahid so why did you not read up on what will be the rulings for you after his departure    sisters it is very important you read up on all the information you can find on your iddah  it s rules and regulations etc  know and calculate your time period   important   remember it is determined in terms of hijri months   be prepared for what are your dos and donts  what you can and cannot wear  not to fall into any biddah traditions which don t apply at all  and most importantly to know your rights as a muslimah  don t let anyone tell you can t do such and such when you are allowed  don t live in ignorance ukhti  if you aren t aware of where to get information go to islamqa and look online and find strong sources  if you can ask a sister to get their husband mahram to ask questions you may be confused or unaware of to a shari is even better inshaallah  may allah swt reward and strenghen all those sisters who are going through and have experienced the iddah and reunite them with their husbands very soon  ameeeeeen     ya ikhwan  fear allah  you are responsible for your wife  you make sure to give all her rights to her and under this comes one of the most important duties of yours brother  and this is to educate your wife  you are a mujahid and you have not once mentioned to your wife ves what her iddah involves  authobillah  brothers make sure you dont do any zulm on your wife or any other woman whom you are put in charge over during her iddah  prepare your wife by educating her  as a man it is much more easier for the brothers to go the mahkama and try and get in touch with a sharii qadhi etc  there is no excuse for ignorance when you can receive the answer just down the street  fear allah over whom you are put in charge over  may allah swt grant us all softness and understanding

do not burden it with him as soon as he comes back home  let him find peace and solace in you and try to understand what he has been through  some brothers end up wishing they could go for a martyrdom operation after marriage due to the stress some sisters cause them  do not be like this  do not overburden him with your demands  learn to cook nice food for him which pleases him and realize that he probably hasn t eaten good food when on ribat  if he needs his rest  let him rest  and do not complain about your standard of living if it is lower than what you were accustomed to  if something needs fixing around the house  wait a day or two before telling him  but this also depends on how much time he has off  as you don t want to leave this until the last day   be presentable in your appearance

online  do not cause him distress over matters which you thought were insignificant yet are great in his eyes there are many articles detailing how a wife should interact with her husband so that he increases in his love for her but sufficient is to know that your kind treatment of him will reflect on how he treats you  a man naturally mirrors good treatment with good treatment  so by you showing him the love and respect he desires  then he would reciprocate with the same loving treatment of you  if not more blessed are those who aid their husbands and encourage them to keep fighting  a humble

2015-July-21_1_11,   whenever the interests of the disbelievers are threatened or harmed by muslims he is the first to jump to their defense  he would speak against his brothers and betray them  he may even advise muslims to spy against one another and report to the authorities  for him fighting for islam  and for the ummah is terrorism  but he manages to shop for afatwa that would allow him to serve in the armies of the disbelievers and fight against his brothers  being a muslim for the sake of the disbelievers permeates his every action  if he meets a muslim he frowns and if he meets a disbeliever his face beams with a smile

2015-July-22_1_10,al muhajirat  lslm `lykm w rhm  llh wbrkth alhamdulilah we have compiled a list of things you should bring with you if you are planning on making hijrah soon  and a bit of naseeha in the end  may allah reward the sisters who compiled the list and may it be a means of benefit for us all  forgive us if we have left anything out but this is what has come to mind at this time  suitcase checklist  everyone has there own preference as to what is important and what they consider special to them but in general these are the things i found useful and happy i brought for hijrah    winter      winter jacket  black or dark blue   waterproof warm boots  good for muddy  rainy days   fleece pajamas as the nights can be very cold in fall winter   sweat pants x    long sleeve sweaters or pullovers   thick socks    or     thermal top and bottom  good quality yoga pants  leggings    or      keep in mind to bring pieces that you can make other outfits with so you don t end up packing a lot   hat and thick scarf   for indoors trust me i wore these so much last winter    there are heaters here alhamdulillah but you most likely won t have them in every room like the kitchen etc    good quality undergarments  bras and underwears and if you are married or plan to marry you might want to bring things you would like to wear in private    you ll also want to bring clothes for both summer and winter that you can maybe wear around your husband as well  maybe things that aren t so appropriate around sisters eg short dresses etc  whatever you prefer  summer      light pants  basic tank tops  maxi dresses and skirts  ones you can wear around sisters covering awra   if you are somali you know what a baati is  light house dress  these are probably the most useful things i own so try and find these if you can   good quality running shoes try and get darker colours  x   pharmaceuticals      tylenol panadol cold and flu  extra strength   allergy pills for spring allergy and anything else  asthma inhaler etc   bring your equipment and medecines for any condition you may have  although medicine is available  you can never be over prepared with it   benadryl allergy cream   small handy first aid kit   disinfectant creams  mosquito after bite cream and spray   if you wear glasses make sure you have prescription number and extra pair of glasses and contact lenses   prenatal vitamins  painkiller that are safe for pregnancy etc     have at least one jilbab in your suitcase and one in the bag you are carrying with you once you are about to cross  preferably in black  two black thin niqaabs  three layered to cover your eyes   toiletries     toiletries are available but ladies personal items are not that great in quality so you might want to bring a zip lock bag full of that if it s important to you  don t waste weight of your suitcase for lotions  shampoos and conditioners  face washes and scrubs and perfumes  these things are all available in sha allah once you arrive   unless you are picky and prefer a certain kind that you know you would never find here   if i could advise you to bring one thing it would be organic coconut oil  maybe grab an extra jar for me as well lol    this is such helpful product with multi use   body moisturizer hair oil etc   wax  cold arabic gum strips roll on  all available  shavers are also here but not in great quality so if thats important bring a few packs   makeup is available if this interested you but again if you have specific things you like be sure to bring a couple of each things   a hair iron as well if you can buy along the way so you don t need a converter plug just incase it burns from the electricity strength   small sewing kit i also found large zip lock bags very useful for keeping my things in place as well as travel cases as sometimes you are living out of your suitcases for months so it just helps keep things a bit more organized  electronics      laptop or android tablet  useful for reading and watching lectures etc    dont download anything that could cause suspicion do all that once you arrive  infact i would advise you have things on your devices that could throw the authorities off if they look through them   android phone  no apple  no iphones ipads macs etc they aren t allowed here so sell them before hand   portable charger  solar and re chargable   memory microsd cards    and    if you can get are best        good quality earphones  charger  like normal ones they only sell fake ones here that take w hours to charge your phone to          don t bring any books you can get them in pdf form here even hisn al muslim can be found here  ya akhawat this is a list for a sister on her own  if you have a child with you remember to bring the necessary things they need  pack as you would if you were going on a long camping trip throught all   seasons  warm clothes  jackets  shoes etc and like wise for the summer  medical equipment and medication  anything and everything  eg  pain killers cough and flu  vitamins  anti infection  sudocream etc  like i said anything and everything it s better to be safe than sorry  everything is provided here but just incase of any type of emergency your child is protected  breast feeding pumps etc  you are the mother and you know what your child needs  it has happened that sisters arrive having lost their suitcases along the way  your things are being smuggled either with you or maybe at a later time  it s important to have a backpack or small duffle bag you can carry with all your most important belongings in  a change of good quality clothes some basic tanks and t s leggings good quality undergarments important medication electronics  all  passport and money all with you at all times  some toiletries enough to last you a good month  tube of toothpaste  toothbrush  q tips  cream  feminine products  soap hampoo etc   though all these can be found here but keep it with you  these are the things you want to take advantage of  but also remember if something happens to them to say alhamdulilah  alaa kulli haal and allah will provide for you what you are missing  if you are planning hijrah on your own it s best to be as discreet as possible  even if you think you can trust someone  it is best to wait until you actually reach until you break the news if that s what you decide  i can say from experience it s not an easy thing but you need to think of what s best for the people you love  keeping them safe from being harmed by the government etc  avoid searching things from your home wi fi and devices you plan to bring  this way you have nothing that can be held against you in the case you were caught  remember allah azza wa jaal is the one who protects but always tie your camel  take your asbab whilst putting your trust in allah  you are leaving the land of kufr for the land of islam so much sacrifice is to be made  the worldly things can be replaced but come prepared with the things you love  have good thoughts of allah and remember the bigger goal and the reward you long for from allah for this act of obedience   indeed  allah loves those who rely upon him         lslm `lykm w rhm  llh wbrkth alhamdulilah we have compiled a list of things you should bring with you if you are planning on making hijrah soon  and a bit of naseeha in the end  may allah reward the sisters who compiled the list and may it be a means of benefit for us all  forgive us if we have left anything out but this is what has come to mind at this time  suitcase checklist  everyone has there own preference as to what is important and what they consider special to them but in general these are the things i found useful and happy i brought for hijrah    winter      winter jacket  black or dark blue   waterproof warm boots  good for muddy  rainy days   fleece pajamas as the nights can be very cold in fall winter   sweat pants x    long sleeve sweaters or pullovers   thick socks    or     thermal top and bottom  good quality yoga pants  leggings    or      keep in mind to bring pieces that you can make other outfits with so you don t end up packing a lot   hat and thick scarf   for indoors trust me i wore these so much last winter    there are heaters here alhamdulillah but you most likely won t have them in every room like the kitchen etc    good quality undergarments  bras and underwears and if you are married or plan to marry you might want to bring things you would like to wear in private    you ll also want to bring clothes for both summer and winter that you can maybe wear around your husband as well  maybe things that aren t so appropriate around sisters eg short dresses etc  whatever you prefer  summer      light pants  basic tank tops  maxi dresses and skirts  ones you can wear around sisters covering awra   if you are somali you know what a baati is  light house dress  these are probably the most useful things i own so try and find these if you can   good quality running shoes try and get darker colours  x   pharmaceuticals      tylenol panadol cold and flu  extra strength   allergy pills for spring allergy and anything else  asthma inhaler etc   bring your equipment and medecines for any condition you may have  although medicine is available  you can never be over prepared with it   benadryl allergy cream   small handy first aid kit   disinfectant creams  mosquito after bite cream and spray   if you wear glasses make sure you have prescription number and extra pair of glasses and contact lenses   prenatal vitamins  painkiller that are safe for pregnancy etc     have at least one jilbab in your suitcase and one in the bag you are carrying with you once you are about to cross  preferably in black  two black thin niqaabs  three layered to cover your eyes   toiletries     toiletries are available but ladies personal items are not that great in quality so you might want to bring a zip lock bag full of that if it s important to you  don t waste weight of your suitcase for lotions  shampoos and conditioners  face washes and scrubs and perfumes  these things are all available in sha allah once you arrive   unless you are picky and prefer a certain kind that you know you would never find here   if i could advise you to bring one thing it would be organic coconut oil  maybe grab an extra jar for me as well lol    this is such helpful product with multi use   body moisturizer hair oil etc   wax  cold arabic gum strips roll on  all available  shavers are also here but not in great quality so if thats important bring a few packs   makeup is available if this interested you but again if you have specific things you like be sure to bring a couple of each things   a hair iron as well if you can buy along the way so you don t need a converter plug just incase it burns from the electricity strength   small sewing kit i also found large zip lock bags very useful for keeping my things in place as well as travel cases as sometimes you are living out of your suitcases for months so it just helps keep things a bit more organized  electronics      laptop or android tablet  useful for reading and watching lectures etc    dont download anything that could cause suspicion do all that once you arrive  infact i would advise you have things on your devices that could throw the authorities off if they look through them   android phone  no apple  no iphones ipads macs etc they aren t allowed here so sell them before hand   portable charger  solar and re chargable   memory microsd cards    and    if you can get are best        good quality earphones  charger  like normal ones they only sell fake ones here that take w hours to charge your phone to          don t bring any books you can get them in pdf form here even hisn al muslim can be found here  ya akhawat this is a list for a sister on her own  if you have a child with you remember to bring the necessary things they need  pack as you would if you were going on a long camping trip throught all   seasons  warm clothes  jackets  shoes etc and like wise for the summer  medical equipment and medication  anything and everything  eg  pain killers cough and flu  vitamins  anti infection  sudocream etc  like i said anything and everything it s better to be safe than sorry  everything is provided here but just incase of any type of emergency your child is protected  breast feeding pumps etc  you are the mother and you know what your child needs  it has happened that sisters arrive having lost their suitcases along the way  your things are being smuggled either with you or maybe at a later time  it s important to have a backpack or small duffle bag you can carry with all your most important belongings in  a change of good quality clothes some basic tanks and t s leggings good quality undergarments important medication electronics  all  passport and money all with you at all times  some toiletries enough to last you a good month  tube of toothpaste  toothbrush  q tips  cream  feminine products  soap hampoo etc   though all these can be found here but keep it with you  these are the things you want to take advantage of  but also remember if something happens to them to say alhamdulilah  alaa kulli haal and allah will provide for you what you are missing  if you are planning hijrah on your own it s best to be as discreet as

2015-June-17_2_12,shaikh ul islam ibn taymiyah  may allaah have mercy on him  said   a righteous wife will be with her righteous husband for many years  and she is the one who is meant in the hadeeth in which the messenger of allaah  sallahu alayhi wa salaam  said   this world is temporary conveniences and the best of its comforts is a believing wife  who when you look at her she pleases you and if you tell her to do something she obeys you  and if you are away from her she protects you with regard to herself and your wealth   this is what the prophet  sallahu alayhi wa salaam  enjoined when the muhaajiroon asked him which kind of wealth they should acquire  and he said   let one of you acquire a tongue that remembers allaah  a thankful heart  and a believing wife who will help him with regard to the hereafter   narrated by at tirmidhee from saalim ibn abi l ja d  from thawbaan  she may offer the love and compassion that allaah speaks of in his book  and the pain of separation may be harder for her than death in some cases  and harder than losing wealth or leaving one s homeland  especially if one of them is fond of the other or they have children together who will be harmed by separation    majmoo  al fataawa

2015-June-19_2_9,allah ta aala says  kutiba `alaykumu lqitalu wahuwa kurhun lakum wa`asa   an takrahuw shayy an wahuwa khayrun lakum wa`asa   an tuhibwuw shayy an wahuwa sharwun lakum wallwahu ya`lamu wa antum la ta`lamuwna  fighting has been prescribed upon you and you dislike it  but it is possible that you dislike a thing that is good for you  and you love a thing that is bad for you  allah knows while you know not           this ayah is a command to the muslims to fight  on a side not  many muslims and islamic jama at say that before we do jihad  there must be tarbiyyah  spritual upbringing   the way they present this idea is that they say the following   tabriyyah is a prerequisite of jihad  therefore without tarbiyyah you cannot do jihad   in other words  they say tarbiyyah is mandatory before jihad  others say   we are in the meccan stage  therefore there should not be any fighting   is this justified  is there a justification for delaying jihad fi sabeelillah  let s change the question to make it easy to understand  if a person became a muslim during ramadan would you tell him that he has to do tarbiyyah before fasting  would you tell him that we are in the meccan phase so you don t have to fast  you have approximately    years before fasting starts since that s when the command came  so before that  you can eat during ramadan and not fast at all  but when those    years are over  you ll have enough tarbiyyah to start fasting  nobody says that  it s a joke  so then  why do we say that about jihad fe sabeelillah  what s the difference when the instruction for jihad is in the same form as the instruction for siyaam  fasting   kutiba `alaykumu lswiyamu fasting has been prescribed upon you kutiba `alaykumu lqitalufighting has been prescribed upon you they are both in surah al baqarah  fasting has been prescribed upon you and fighting has been prescribed upon you  so how come we are treating them differently  in fact  fasting was prescribed after jihad fe sabeelillah  the order for fasting came    years after prophethood and the order for jihad came    years after prophethood  how come there was a two year difference  therefore  logically speaking  we should tell people that before fasting they should do tarbiyyah  how come we prescribe tarbiyyah before jihad when the prophet  salallahu  alayhi wasallam  didn t do it  when a person became muslim  did he tell that person to study under shuyookh and then he can do jihad  did he say you have to learn arabic or go overseas to study islam before doing jihad  narrated abu hurayrah   amr ibn uqaysh had given usurious loans in pre  islamic period  so he disliked embracing islam until he took them  he came on the day of uhud and asked   where are my cousins   they  the people  replied   at uhud   he asked   where is so and so   they said   at uhud   he asked   where is so and so   they said   at uhud   he then put on his coat of mail and rode his horse  he then proceeded towards them  when the muslims saw him  they said   keep away  amir   he said   i have become a believer   he fought until he was wounded  he was then taken to his family wounded  sa d ibn mu adh came to his sister   ask him  whether he fought  out of partisanship  out of anger for them  or out of anger for allah   he said   out of anger of allah and his apostle   he then died and entered paradise  he did not offer any prayer for allah    abu dawud  when he became muslim  did the prophet  salallahu  alayhi wasallam  tell him to study qur an or hadith  uqaysh didn t do anything but fight in the path of allah and died shaheed  he achieved the highest status a muslim could ever get  who would need more tarbiyyah than a jew  people say muslims need a lot of tarbiyyah before jihad  well a jew would need more tarbiyyah  bukhayreek converted in the battle of uhud and died shaheed  the prophet  salallahu  alayhi wasallam  said  bukhayreek is the best of jews   he didn t go through any intensive spiritual training courses  nevertheless the prophet  salallahu  alayhi wasallam  said he was the best of jews  why  because he fought on the battlefield and died shaheed  this is not to belittle tarbiyyah at all  but when we make it a strict prerequisite for jihad  we see that it is not necessary  so then what is the reason why many muslims require tarbiyyah before jihad  because allah said   fighting has been prescribed upon you and you dislike it   that s why  the reason is because people dislike it and try to find a reason for bailing out of jihad  therefore  they say that we have to have tarbiyyah or the enemy is too strong  it is part of our human make up  it s part of our fitrah  allah said so  the reality of war is something that most people don t like  it was a gut feeling during the time of the sahaba and it s a gut feeling today    sheikh al haafidh yusuf al uyayri  rahimahullah
2015-June-28_2_3,it is a day that will go down in history  a day of resistance and memory  the day when the law was accepted  that in all    states same sex marriage is permitted  oh  but it it is not for that reason that it shall be remembered  it is not for this we praise  to convert our bodies to those of pigs  we do not live to oppose the way of nature  nor do we agree with this repeat  the resemblance of now to the past is very great how little have people learned from the lake of lut  they are all drowning their future   in a river which flows but to one direction  it is in hell they shall reside  taking back what they now call in pride  in   different locations a family was born its name was change  freedom and revenge  change for the life we have been forced to live  without any freedom or choice  where we cannot practice our creed  revenge  this is an answer to our imprisonment  they try to make us deaf  dumb and blind to the light of allaah  but it will always outshine  kuwait  france and tunisia is where they reside  they left a mark which will always remain  permanent and blunt  with many looking upto what more could be done  with a future without any bounds  the numbers of minus s is not what was great  but the effect of the threat is what it defines  to leave one strapped in their seat in a car without any brakes  is where the joy lies  just as many innocent reside in homes which are known as only co ordinates locations which pay no heed to children running in all directions they forget of the women making her husband a meal or of the farmer running a simple errand  no  but you view our people as only  north south west or east  when you clearly show that you have no pity for all  stop shouting your slogans for peace  listen to me i will let you in on a secret  they define you as only   selections  you are either for them or against them  and they have made it very clear  they will not let you live a life of peace if you proclaim the testimony of one  and this is a war  so silent and deadly a war where they have covered you all with a cloak of ignorance and bliss you are only shown what they want you to see open your eyes  do not be controlled  maybe you understand and maybe you don t just know this  if you show no mercy with us then why should we with you
2015-June-28_2_4,al muhajirat  most sisters when in the land of kuffr have a different understanding on what living under the khilafah will be like before arriving  they expect perfection  complete organisation and a perfect system set up for them to participate in whatever roles appeal to them whether that be a mother or a teacher or a nurse  thinking that the khilafah has been established so everything within it must already be set up and thriving  the reality is that dawlatul islam today isnt perfect in the sense that maybe you or i might have imagined it to be  coming from the land of kuffr  the land of injustice  to the land of islam is indeed an upscale no matter how big the sacrifices  but at the same time we must come to understand that this is a new born state with problems here and there but that doesn t mean we should sacrifice any less for it  though wallah these are minor  very minor compared to the issues in the land of kuffr  but we expect perfection to rise before us without even working hard to establish and help the khilafah thrive  waallahul musta aan  think of it like this  when an infant begins to take his first steps  he waddles from side to side not even able to stand upright  but that doesnt stop you from supporting him in each step  encouraging him to try again and helping him continue in his journey to walking steadly and eventually running  you wouldn t shun him for every small step he takes so why do this to the khilafah  rather than finding faults within it why not put your effort in improving it  this newly born state is our responsibility as muslims from all around the earth  young and old to help it prosper  we need to be the ones who help bring victory to the religion of allah as we are the ones who need it most wallahi  as the fist generation in our time to migrate to this blessed land  the ones who will fight for it and and give it everything we can to become what it is promissed by allah to become  and maybe that means that we will never bear the fruits of it in this dunya as many of the sahabiyyeen but at least we would have fulfilled our purpose  whether that means that our blood will be spilt or we sacrifice all the pleasures of the dunya  know ya ukhti  you will encounter things here that will displease you whether it be the mannerisms of the people or the conditions you are in but you must not forget it s not the hardship that matters but the final reward from allah  remember that everyone has there own struggles amd we are all flawd  the mujahideen are not perfect and neither are the muhajiraat  we are here to help one another attain jannah and raise the kalimah of allah so be soft with people and always remind yourself of the reward you will attain by the permission of allah through your patience through tough times  whether that be major or minor  as abu umamah  raa  narrated that the prophet  saaw  said   allah the almighty says  os son of adam if you keep patient and hope for my reward on the first shock of calamity i will not be satisfied with any reward for that except paradise    so remember that the islamic state is the state of the muslims and we are responsible for making it grow and flourish  if we aren t aiding it then who are we to criticize it and those who are working tirelessly to improve it  this islamic state is our state to raise our

2015-June-28_2_7,al muhajirat   surely with difficulty is ease   allah places difficulties in our path to test us  our sincerity  our intentions  our strength and so on wa allahu a lam  whenever we do come accross these tests we should make sure that one of the things we do feel is determination to find the sweetness of the closness to allah during them and to eventually come out after  closer to allah ta ala  okay   my point basically upon arrival you expect cheerful khilafah with everyone always singing nasheed and people handing out candies  but the reality is that just because you ve made hijrah and answered the call it doesn t mean that you re life will be smooth and dandy  dandy   idk lol  you will be tested in shaa allah  tests are an obligation upon the people of imaan and if allah tests his messengers and those closest in piety more than anyone than what makes you think that your fitan of this world have ended after hijrah  we should infact expect the trials to increase and try for patience throughout them  with my experience and mostly everyone around me we notice that we truly get tested once we make a final decision to make hijrah all the way until we actually crossed into the khilafah and then throughout our life here  this isn t something i m saying to put you off hijrah or anything of thats sort  the sisters who come here unmarried marry mujahideen  the best men of the ummah today  but that doesn t mean the brothers are perfect and that doesn t mean your marriage will be a romantic fairytale  it doesn t mean that when we become the wife of a shaheed or the mother of an orphan that our lives don t become difficult  we get monthly incomes and housing and appliances and food etc  but that doesn t mean you will live in a palace and eat luxury foods  though that s not what life is about  you may face trials in your marriage  you may face trials with your dunya matters  or with your families and you might even face trials with your health but that shouldn t put you off hijrah one bit just as free housing and a mujahid husband shouldn t attract you to it  when the wife of ja far ibn abi talib  asma made hijrah with her husband that she had just married she didn t get ease  once she answered the call of hijrah again with her husband and three children  leaving the place she called home for years  the home her children grew up in she didn t look back because she undertood what hijrah entailed  and do you think the trials ended for asma bint umais after her second hijrah  they increased  her husband that was with her throught her journey through islam and both migrations  attained his shahada and she was left to care for her children  then her second husband passed away and then her son  you see the trials of her imaan never really stopped until her very last moments  she radiyaallahu  anha is just one example of the women we should always look up to  her strength as a mother and wife  patience through difficulties  and her faith in allah  allah places these tests in your path for a reason if a minor problem befalls you in your marriage  know that maybe allah is testing your sincerity  you said your hijrah was for allah ta ala and not to accompany your husband or for marriage maybe this test is your chance to prove it  or maybe allah is pulling you back towards him because you ve preoccupied yourself with your husband s affairs  wa allahu a lam  if allah tests you with a problem in your health take tgis as a opportunity to use up more of your time to get closer to him to thank him for the good health you still have  if a fitna befalls you with the people around you pull yourself towards allah and channel your efforts towards obeying him rather than complaining  perhaps you were busying yourself with the people s affairs rather than your own  or you commited an act of transgression towards your brother sister and allah hastened to you with the punishment in this dunya rather than the akhirah  anas  raa  reported that the prophet  saaw  said    when allah wills good for a servant of his  he expedites his punishment in this life  and when he wills retribution for a servant of his  he holds his sins for him to judge him by them on the day of resurrection     tirmidee   allahu a lam this is all hypothetical  so ya ahl alhijrah and those planning for it expect trials and hope to see the fruits of you patience in the hearafter through these fitan  i mean always remind yourself to search for the ease within the difficulty search for the positive within what our absent mind may think is a negative and ofcourse expect the best from your lord  anything that i have said the is correct is from allah and any mistakes i have made are from myself  in shaa allah you have benefited from this and jazakum allahu khair   surely with difficulty is ease   allah places difficulties in our path to test us  our sincerity  our intentions  our strength and so on wa allahu a lam  whenever we do come accross

2015-June-28_2_8,al muhajirat  when the filthy infidel media or even the  muslim  community worldwide speak about the pure muhajirat  that their filthy mouths shouldn t even speak of  they accuse our hijrah to solely being a sexual one  or that our role here  in a land blessed by the law of allah  is to keep the mujahideen of the islamic state pleased in that manner  may allah protect us from such filthy talk and accusations  wallahi you will be held accountable for such accusations and wallahi the pure muhajirat and free from them  we are here to live under the shade of the sharia of allah  to practice islam freely without being scrutinized by the public and the governments of kuffr  to raise our children  to nurture their fitrah  without the corrupt western system and culture  by the grace of allah we are married to men who don t distort the teachings of islam  men who don t see jihad as a thing of the past  they commit to the obligation of jihad just as any other obligation  though they are just that  men  they aren t perfect  your akhawat aim to please allah  not fearing the blame of the blamers  through the sunnah of the sahabiyyat and the salaf  to follow the examples of khadijah  aisha and umm salamah and the examples of atiqa  asma bint  umais  al khansaa and safiyyah  if this means that the world questions our choices of living  that the rest of this islamic ummah looks down upon us because we choose to marry and then again re marry once allah has decreed that our husbands are killed  following the sunnah of asma bint  umais  raa   who was the epitome of patience and married thrice enduring trial after trial all for the sake of allah  she left her home  her family and her comfort to make hijrah twice from one land to another  and the sunnah of umm salamah  raa  who married twice  may allah be pleased with them both  then so be it  let them mock and slander  we are here to please allah not mere people made of clay  umm salamah and abu salamah embraced islam together  migrated to abbisynia on the first hijrah together and shared children  they went through the tough times of the people around them turning on them thus making them closer  you can only imagine how close their bond and love for one another was  may allah be pleased with them  allah tested her in ways maybe some can relate to in one way or another  an incident took place where her family was split apart and even her beloved children were torn away from her whilst the muslims were making hijrah to madinah  soon after by the help of allah they were returned to her and she was able to proceed with her hijrah to madinah  alone without her husband  who was there waiting for her  putting her trust solely on allah  she was the wife of a mujahid and a noble one for that matter  abu salamah took part in the battle of badr and the battle of uhud  in which he became seriously wounded  he underwent treatment for sometime and the wound apparently healed  but that was only on the surface as it continued to fester inside  not long after the battle of uhud the muslims were once again under attack  the battle was won  but abu salamah was in a very serious condition  he was approaching death  the prophet  saaw  prayed for him and consoled him and not long after he passed away  umm salamah remained patient after he died  as the prophet  saaw  knew the diffuculty of loosing a husband he consoled  he understood the difficulties of being a widow and was very much aware of the struggles her now orphaned children would face  she  raa  reported  i heard the messenger of allah saying   when a person suffers from a calamity and utters  `inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji`un  allahumma ujurni fi musibati  wakhluf li khairan minha  we belong to allah and to him we shall return  o allah  compensate me in my affliction  recompense my loss and give me something better in exchange for it  then allah surely compensates him with reward and better substitute   umm salamah  raa  said  when abu salamah  raa  died  i repeated the same supplication as the messenger of allah had commanded me  to do   so allah bestowed upon me a better substitute than him  abu salamah    muslim   she asked  and who could be better than abu salamah  allah knew best and answered her du a with his messenger  he  saaw  married her to look after her and her newly orphaned children and told her to remain patient and not to grieve after abu salamah s death that her children were like his children and vowed to always take care of them  may allah s peace and blessings be upon him  we strive to be like her and the likes of umm musa and asma bint abi bakr  they not only loved jihad but longed for it  they would give up not only themselves for the sake of allah and this religion  but considered their husbands and children  who were the best of men of this ummah  cheap for the sake of allah  it was said about asma bint abi bakr by her son  urwah  i entered upon my my mother with my brother  abdullah ibn az zubayr      days before abdullah was killed  and she was in pain  abdullah said  how are you    in pain  she said  he said  perhaps there is a peace in death  she replied  perhaps it is that you desire my death  so don t  she laughed  then said  by allah i don t wish to die untilthere comes one of your two ends  his fight with alhajjaj  either that you are killed and i remain patient after your death  or that you are granted victory and my eyes are delighted  and beware of accepting a plan that you do not agree with only out of your hatered of death  urwah said  my brother meant by his previous words that if he was killed it would grieve her as she was     years of age   siyar alam annubala        so you see ya ukhti we should learn from these beautiful women who raised lions  ya allah allow for us to raise true warriors and encourage them with complete obedience to allah  gain the reward ya ukhti  of continuously aiding a fighter  help equip him with your wealth  feed him  and clothe him so that you may share in the reward as our beloved prophet  saaw  said   he who equips a warrior in the way of allah  is like the one who actually fights  and whoever looks after the family of a warrior in the way of allah  in his absence  has infact participated in the battle   muslim  remember that this dunya is finite and that our main goal is to constantly increase in rewards and rank in the everlasting hereafter  don t hinder the men of the ummah from this cause  fear allah  do not be like those whom allah mentioned in this ayah   those who love the life of this world more than the hereafter who hinder  men  from the path of allah and seek crookedness therin  they are astray by a far distance   ibrahim     do not let your heart get attached to your husband to the extent that you try to stop him from approaching the front lines  rather push him  show him that you are pleased with him when he is away fighting the enemies of allah  oh weak hearted one do not misinterpret this to mean that we want to rid ourselves of our husbands  that we want them dead  rather we want them to truly live  in the everlasting heavens under the throne of allah  there is nothing more beloved to us than shahada  so we wish for our loved ones to attain what is most loved by us  so we encourage them to kill and be killed for the sake of allah  it will be difficult wallahi it will be difficult  there are days where you long for the support and comfort of your husband when he is away  and there is no sugar coating the feeling of knowing your husband will never return to you in this dunya after he is killed  but ya ukhti you must remember this dunya is full of losses allah created us to worship him and him alone  to sacrifice ourselves and the things and people we love most  for him  as we belong to him and to him is our return  this dunya is only moments of happiness don t let it fool you and don t let these trials bring your eman down  this may be your test or perhaps the beginning of your test but have trust in allah s plan and attatch yourself to him  and remember   jihad is ordained for you  muslims  though you dislike it  and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you  allah knows but you do not know    albaqarah       in my time here i ve met so many beautiful sisters that would remind you of the women of the salaf  so young but sincere may allah grant them thabaat  i stayed close to this sister i always looked up to  she was in her late    s  she was newly married and really looking forward to having children  after a year with her new husband allah granted her a child  her husband was rarely home always on the front lines  but once he found out that he was going to be a father he was very pleased  near the end of her pregnancy he became more attached and stayed home more often  she would approach him almost daily and show him a mirror and say  look here  your face has no noor  you have no noor  do you know why  because you are sitting at home and not on the frontlines   he became ashamed of his state  he began going out more often again  and a few weeks before her due date he was killed in a battle  may allah accept him  without seeing his child  this beautiful sister later married again though i remember it was very hard for her to even consider it  but she re married  not because of the lies western media claim  but because of her son  she knew that he would need a male figure in his life and just like the women of the salaf she saw that this was where greater reward lies  may allah grant her firdaws  i met another sister who was very eager about jihad  her husband was constantly away working whether it be ribaat or battles or general work for this khilafah  but from time to time he would spend some time away from work to stay home with her  on one occasion he spent a month or two with her  they had a beautiful marriage one of respect and obedience to allah  she remaind patient with his stay for some time but soon after couldn t bare the thought that men of this ummah were out protecting it with their chests whilst her husband was at home next to her  what about the sisters who haven t seen their husbands for months  what about the prisoners  she would constantly nag him about it telling him to buy himself a jilbab if he was going to stay home like women did  a few months later he was also was killed  ra  and by allah the news delighted her because she looked past the trials and thought about the reward of allah  she was proud that her husband  the man she took care of and made sure to do her part in aiding  had by the permission of allah reached his goal  this is my last short story for you and with it comes a lesson in sha allah  soon after my arrival i met a sister  she had a beautiful child  may allah bless them  quiet sister but full of noor  i asked a sister i had met earlier on what her story was  everyone here has a story you could write a best selling novel about  anywho    i was told she came here with her husband and not long after their arrival to sham she had a child  she spoke of stories she d heard through the particular sister and other sisters as well  she spoke of how much her and her husband loved one another and of their hijrah  it was a so beautiful i was in awe  may allah bless her  then she told me how he was killed a while back  i admired her strength saw her composer and how she held herself together so gracefully  a widow and a mother of an orphan  she then told me how she had just recently got re married  i stopped  it was as if my vision was shattered  i felt betrayed  how could a love so real just end up this way  how could she re marry after him  how could she love someone like that and then just marry another after him  i couldn t get passed it  i just kept thinking  may allah forgive me i knew nothing about life in the land of jihad  i knew nothing about her struggles as a widow and a mother  i knew nothing about her  but i judged her  my ignorance got in the way of my reasoning and not long after i was placed in her situation  i became a widow  i now understood the struggles of being a woman without a mahram in a different land  it felt different to read the stories of the sahabiyyat who became widows  it felt more real  they weren t just stories anymore  though their struggle was far greater than this  i felt i could relate  she was there to comfort me to tell me that in our situation  in our times it s perfectly fine to think about marriage  again  that it didn t take away from your love for your husband  she listened to me tell her stories about my husband over  and over again without the slightest disinterest  she didn t judge me like i did to her  she consoled me  told me stories about the sahabiyyat  she helped me educate myself about the rewards i was able to get through marriage  by preparing a fighter for the sake of allah  about how bearing more children to kill and be killed for allah s sake held an even greater reward  that the prophet  saaw  will boast about the number of his ummah and we will have contributed to it  what an honor that would all be  i finally understood this struggle  i now undertand her and other widows  how she could have loved someone like that and then  just  re married  she didn t  just  re marry  she undertood the hardships and the rewards that came before it and the ones that would come after that decision  so she made a decision  most importantly she had full reliance in allah and sold her dunya for the rewards of the akhira  may allah bless her and grant her firdaws  and by allah with women like this we will succeed as an ummah  wallahi ya akhawat there is no shame in marriage and there is nothing wrong in getting re married even more than once  let the sahabiyyat be your examples don t be put down by what the kuffar or even the muslims  who view this as a taboo issue  say  don t let their words and accusations discourage you  you know what is best for you and your child ren   you know where your reward lies  my dear akhawat don t ever think that getting re married means that you don t love or appreciate your first husband  many presume that true love between spouses has a time period  but love can t be measured by time but rather  the affect the person has made on you  how they ve helped you grow as a person and your outlook on life because of the experiences you shared with them  it could be that you are married for    years spending every moment with one another or maybe you ve had   months together and because of the barakah allah places within the marriage  solely because it was for his sake that it feels like a life time  the time you spend with one another in the land of jihad will never amount to the years spent outside  don t be fooled into thinking that just because a sister has been with her husband for years she is more attatched that she would be less likely to re marry after he is killed  than the one who has spent mere months  wallahi i ve seen that those who were very much attached to their husband  those who loved them so dearly that they truly mourned for   months and    days  were also ones to get re married  they didn t let the words of the juhala  ignorant  blind their reasoning rather they did what was best for them not just in dunya but akhira as well  and oh you who belittle and judge those who have chosen to go through this path of re marriage  fear allah  humble yourselves lest allah make it a lesson for you and put you through an experience similar or maybe worse  be a person of understanding and mercy  may allah have mercy on you             a sister once gave me a beautiful naseeha  she said  look i know this is cliche but love never dies you ll always love him and no one can replace him  moving on is always something we have to do and just because we move on it doesn t mean the memories cancel out  know that whoever it is that you marry next  they can never take away the memories you had with one another  as i see it  your marriage happened and it was beautiful and you loved him so now no matter what happens  nothing can change that  don t marry trying to replace or to make yourself feel better  always put allaah before your husband  love allaah and do things for your husband with the intention of pleasing allaah  that way you won t feel bad about your first husband and you ll always know that his place is cherished  you didn t get married to get over his sadness  just don t rush or pressure yourself into anything  take things slowly  easily and gradually  whatever happens next is what was written for you   when the filthy infidel media or even the  muslim  community worldwide speak about the pure muhajirat  that their filthy mouths shouldn t even speak of  they accuse our hijrah to solely being a sexual one  or that our role here  in a land blessed by the law of allah  is to keep the mujahideen of the islamic state pleased in that manner  may allah protect us from such filthy talk and accusations  wallahi you will be held accountable for such accusations and wallahi the pure muhajirat and free from them  we are here to live under the shade of the sharia of allah  to practice islam freely without being scrutinized by the public and the

was very much aware of the struggles her now orphaned children would face  she  raa  reported  i heard the messenger of allah saying   when a person suffers from a calamity and utters  `inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji`un  allahumma ujurni fi musibati  wakhluf li khairan minha  we belong to allah and to him we shall return  o allah  compensate me in my affliction  recompense my loss and give me something better in exchange for it  then allah surely compensates him with reward and better substitute   umm salamah  raa  said  when abu salamah  raa  died  i repeated the same supplication as the messenger of allah had commanded me  to do   so allah bestowed upon me a better substitute than him  abu salamah    muslim   she asked  and who could be better than abu salamah  allah knew best and answered her du a with his messenger  he  saaw  married her to look after her and her newly orphaned children and told her to remain patient and not to grieve after abu salamah s death that her children were like his children and vowed to always take care of them  may allah s peace and blessings be upon him  we strive to be like her and the likes of umm musa and asma bint abi bakr  they not only loved jihad but longed for it  they would give up not only themselves for the sake of allah and this religion  but considered their husbands and children  who were the best of men of this ummah  cheap for the sake of allah  it was said about asma bint abi bakr by her son  urwah  i entered upon my my mother with my brother  abdullah ibn az zubayr      days before abdullah was killed  and she was in pain  abdullah said  how are you    in pain  she said  he said  perhaps there is a peace in death  she replied  perhaps it is that you desire my death  so don t  she laughed  then said  by allah i don t wish to die untilthere comes one of your two ends  his fight with alhajjaj  either that you are killed and i remain patient after your death  or that you are granted victory and my eyes are delighted  and beware of accepting a plan that you do not agree with only out of your hatered of death  urwah said  my brother meant by his previous words that if he was killed it would grieve her as she was     years of age   siyar alam annubala        so you see ya ukhti we should learn from these beautiful women who raised lions  ya allah allow for us to raise true warriors and encourage them with complete obedience to allah  gain the reward ya ukhti  of continuously aiding a fighter  help equip him with your wealth  feed him  and clothe him so that you may share in the reward as our beloved prophet  saaw  said   he who equips a warrior in the way of allah  is like the one who actually fights  and whoever looks after the family of a warrior in the way of allah  in his absence  has infact participated in the battle   muslim  remember that this dunya is finite and that our main goal is to constantly increase in rewards and rank in the everlasting hereafter  don t hinder the men of the ummah from this cause  fear allah  do not be like those whom allah mentioned in this ayah   those who love the life of this world more than the hereafter who hinder  men  from the path of allah and seek crookedness therin  they are astray by a far distance   ibrahim     do not let your heart get attached to your husband to the extent that you try to stop him from approaching the front lines  rather push him  show him that you are pleased with him when he is away fighting the enemies of allah  oh weak hearted one do not misinterpret this to mean that we want to rid ourselves of our husbands  that we want them dead  rather we want them to truly live  in the everlasting heavens under the throne of allah  there is nothing more beloved to us than shahada  so we wish for our loved ones to attain what is most loved by us  so we encourage them to kill and be killed for the sake of allah  it will be difficult wallahi it will be difficult  there are days where you long for the support and comfort of your husband when he is away  and there is no sugar coating the feeling of knowing your husband will never return to you in this dunya after he is killed  but ya ukhti you must remember this dunya is full of losses allah created us to worship him and him alone  to sacrifice ourselves and the things and people we love most  for him  as we belong to him and to him is our return  this dunya is only moments of happiness don t let it fool you and don t let these trials bring your eman down  this may be your test or perhaps the beginning of your test but have trust in allah s plan and attatch yourself to him  and remember   jihad is ordained for you  muslims  though you dislike it  and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you  allah knows but you do not know    albaqarah       in my time here i ve met so many beautiful sisters that would remind you of the women of the salaf  so young but sincere may allah grant them thabaat  i stayed close to this sister i always looked up to  she was in her late    s  she was newly married and really looking forward to having children  after a year with her new husband allah granted her a child  her husband was rarely home always on the front lines  but once he found out that he was going to be a father he was very pleased  near the end of her pregnancy he became more attached and stayed home more often  she would approach him almost daily and show him a mirror and say  look here  your face has no noor  you have no noor  do you know why  because you are sitting at home and not on the frontlines   he became ashamed of his state  he began going out more often again  and a few weeks before her due date he was killed in a battle  may allah accept him  without seeing his child  this beautiful sister later married again though i remember it was very hard for her to even consider it  but she re married  not because of the lies western media claim  but because of her son  she knew that he would need a male figure in his life and just like the women of the salaf she saw that this was where greater reward lies  may allah grant her firdaws  i met another sister who was very eager about jihad  her husband was constantly away working whether it be ribaat or battles or general work for this khilafah  but from time to time he would spend some time away from work to stay home with her  on one occasion he spent a month or two with her  they had a beautiful marriage one of respect and obedience to allah  she remaind patient with his stay for some time but soon after couldn t bare the thought that men of this ummah were out protecting it with their chests whilst her husband was at home next to her  what about the sisters who haven t seen their husbands for months  what about the prisoners  she would constantly nag him about it telling him to buy himself a jilbab if he was going to stay home like women did  a few months later he was also was killed  ra  and by allah the news delighted her because she looked past the trials and thought about the reward of allah  she was proud that her husband  the man she took care of and made sure to do her part in aiding  had by the permission of allah reached his goal  this is my last short story for you and with it comes a lesson in sha allah  soon after my arrival i met a sister  she had a beautiful child  may allah bless them  quiet sister but full of noor  i asked a sister i had met earlier on what her story was  everyone here has a story you could write a best selling novel about  anywho    i was told she came here with her husband and not long after their arrival to sham she had a child  she spoke of stories she d heard through the particular sister and other sisters as well  she spoke of how much her and her husband loved one another and of their hijrah  it was a so beautiful i was in awe  may allah bless her  then she told me how he was killed a while back  i admired her strength saw her composer and how she held herself together so gracefully  a widow and a mother of an orphan  she then told me how she had just recently got re married  i stopped  it was as if my vision was shattered  i felt betrayed  how could a love so real just end up this way  how could she re marry after him  how could she love someone like that and then just marry another after him  i couldn t get passed it  i just kept thinking  may allah forgive me i knew nothing about life in the land of jihad  i knew nothing about her struggles as a widow and a mother  i knew nothing about her  but i judged her  my ignorance got in the way of my reasoning and not long after i was placed in her situation  i became a widow  i now understood the struggles of being a woman without a mahram in a different land  it felt different to read the stories of the sahabiyyat who became widows  it felt more real  they weren t just stories anymore  though their struggle was far greater than this  i felt i could relate  she was there to comfort me to tell me that in our situation  in our times it s perfectly fine to think about marriage  again  that it didn t take away from your love for your husband  she listened to me tell her stories about my husband over  and over again without the slightest disinterest  she didn t judge me like i did to her  she consoled me  told me stories about the sahabiyyat  she helped me educate myself about the rewards i was able to get through marriage  by preparing a fighter for the sake of allah  about how bearing more children to kill and be killed for allah s sake held an even greater reward  that the prophet  saaw  will boast about the number of his ummah and we will have contributed to it  what an honor that would all be  i finally understood this struggle  i now undertand her and other widows  how she could have loved someone like that and then  just  re married  she didn t  just  re marry  she undertood the hardships and the rewards that came before it and the ones that would come after that decision  so she made a decision  most importantly she had full reliance in allah and sold her dunya for the rewards of the akhira  may allah bless her and grant her firdaws  and by allah with women like this we will succeed as an ummah  wallahi ya akhawat there is no shame in marriage and there is nothing wrong in getting re married even more than once  let the sahabiyyat be your examples don t be put down by what the kuffar or even the muslims  who view this as a taboo issue  say  don t let their words and accusations discourage you  you know what is best for you and your child ren   you know where your reward lies  my dear akhawat don t ever think that getting re married means that you don t love or appreciate your first husband  many presume that true love between spouses has a time period  but love can t be measured by time but rather  the affect the person has made on you  how they ve helped you grow as a person and your outlook on life because of the experiences you shared with them  it could be that you are married for    years spending every moment with one another or maybe you ve had   months together and because of the barakah allah places within the marriage  solely because it was for his sake that it feels like a life time  the time you spend with one another in the land of jihad will never amount to the years spent outside  don t be fooled into thinking that just because a sister has been with her husband for years she is more attatched that she would be less likely to re marry after he is killed  than the one who has spent mere months  wallahi i ve seen that those who were very much attached to their husband  those who loved them so dearly that they truly mourned for   months and    days  were also ones to get re married  they didn t let the words of the juhala  ignorant  blind their reasoning rather they did what was best for them not just in dunya but akhira as well  and oh you who belittle and judge those who have chosen to go through this path of re marriage  fear allah  humble yourselves lest allah make it a lesson for you and put you through an experience similar or maybe worse  be a person of understanding and mercy  may allah have mercy on you             a sister once gave me a beautiful naseeha  she said  look i know this is cliche but love never dies you ll always love him and no one can replace him  moving on is always something we have to do and just because we move on it doesn t mean the memories cancel out  know that whoever it is that you marry next  they can never take away the memories you had with one another  as i see it  your marriage happened and it was beautiful and you loved him so now no matter what happens 
2015-May-03_3_1,you have sold your souls to allah ta ala and you have become pleased with jannah as a price for it  and he subhanahu is the one who decides in what way he wants to deposit the merchandise that he bought  and there is nothing for you to do except submit and be satisfied  because by selling it  it leaves your ownership  so if he wishes  he will test you with imprisonment  and if he wills  he will bestow martyrdom on you  and it is not for you to place conditions and say  we want martyrdom and we do not want imprisonment
